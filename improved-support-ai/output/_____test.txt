tobero: 
Lemme try adding the kick thing
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero make regex with all commands
jokbon: 
and make single ansver with whole documentation
tobero: 
You mean a auto reply for each command.
Alright. But that will take some time
jokbon: 
because maximum costumn commands is 100 and when we run out were fked
jokbon: 
if regex have limit then split commands in 4 pieces to groups or something
jokbon: 
lets say you can group extension commands (but remember detection must be reverse also cause peple swap word orders often or speak with gramatic mistakes)
jokbon: 
so if person wants to get extension he might ask:

downloads extension
downloads extensions
download extension
download extensions
extensions download
extensions downloads
extension download
extension downloads
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero thats just for one ü§£
tobero: 
Doesn't yagpdb have a feature for string similarity?
jokbon: 
```downloads.*extension|downloads.*extensions|download.*extension|download.*extension|sextensions.*download|extensions.*downloads|extension.*download|extension.*downloads```
jokbon: 
dont think so
jokbon: 
i tryed using contains but it works wery dumb
.
jokbon: 
it cant contain regex
jokbon: 
if u check contains it must contain whole sentence u wrote in it
jokbon: 
you can shorter the word
tobero: 
That wouldn't make a problem for extension download, as example, just put download in the contains.
How often is download on this servrer used without extensions
jokbon: 
downl.*extens|downl.*extens
jokbon: 
that could work too
jokbon: 
but u cant make it too short or it will mess up with other words users say
jokbon: 
if user writes `how to get faction land extended`
jokbon: 
and you use `get exten` for extensions
jokbon: 
it will start sh*ting false positives
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero
jokbon: 
so its safer to use whole words
tobero: 
okey. Thank you
jokbon: 
its just better to setup with alot of dumb effort or else it messes up everything like cobweb
u will end up geting 12 ansvers for one question
jokbon: 
i doubt you are trying to set up those ansvers about commands see its too hard lol
tobero: 
Hope you know regex is one if the things I have to deal with when writing the plugin, right?

I haven't had time, because the plugin currently has bugs that needs to be fixed first
jokbon: 
hmm iama try
jokbon: 
Papi:

    %faction_name% - Get the faction name of the player
    %faction_registry% - Get the regsitry
    %faction_members% - Get the member count (Total)
    %faction_members_online% - Get the online member count
    %faction_power% - Get the current power level of the faction
    %faction_maxpower% - Get the max power the faction can currently have
    %faction_balance% - Get the balance of the faction bank (! Needs vault & a bank supporting plugin)
    %faction_claims% - Get the total amount of claims
jokbon: 
.-------------------- claim
jokbon: 
/f claim - This will execute
/f claim one
/f claim auto - Claims every chunk you walk on
/f claim one - This will claim the current chunk you are standing in
/f claimPower - Displays how many chunks can be claimed until you run out of power
YAGPDB.xyz: 

jokbon: 
oh i need to update this too
jokbon: 
/f create - Creates your faction. Name it whatever you like. But don't use spaces
/f delete - Deletes faction
/f description <Text... blah blah text> - Set descrption (currently unused)
/f invite <Player> - Sends a invite to the player if he is online. The player will then receive a clickable message that allows them to join the faction
/f inviteaccept <Faction> - Accept a invite if you can't click messages (android/IOS)
/f join <Faction> - Join a public faction. Every faction is by default set to private to prevent unexpected intruders
/f kick <Player> - Kicks a player from your faction
/f leave - Leave your current faction, unless you are the owner
/f listbanned - Displays all banned players from the faction

jokbon: 
from now on autoansvers group will work only in these 2 chanels
jokbon: 
if u want it global add new command group called global autoansvers
jokbon: 
then allow it to every channel
tobero: 
Okey. Thanks
tobero: 
Will take a look at designing the embed for that tomorrow
jokbon: 
bruh just do
jokbon: 
```{{ $time :=  currentTime }}
{{ $MessageDiscription := (joinStr "" 
    "**Plugin put itself in safemode because of bug.**\n"
    "**Properly report the problem:**\n"
    "Please send Tobero the crash log (inside console or from your servers logs folder).\n"
    "**Important note:**\n"
    "Don't cut the logs, because in that way its harder for developer to fix it.\n"
)}}

{{$embed := cembed 
    "title" "**ImprovedFactions**" 
    "description" $MessageDiscription
    "footer" 
    (sdict 
        "text" "ImprovedFactions"
    )
    "timestamp" $time
}}
{{ sendMessage nil $embed }}```
