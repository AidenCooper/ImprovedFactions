jokbon: 
in your case some translation is missing
jokbon: 
either outdated language file or another if bug
jokbon: 
try regenerating language file
jokbon: 
New version will not contain any of this localization since it forces dev to finish up everything.
kitsugure: 
alright thanks for the answer
kitsugure: 
also, how can I unclaim a chunk? my friend currently cant break stuff because i claimed a part of a chunk that's close to his house
kitsugure:

josh65: 
It's properly coming from command descriptions. You can turn it off by running the `/f user` command. Unclaim chunks by using `/f unclaim`
jokbon: 
u cant unblaim chunks
jokbon: 
works as intended
