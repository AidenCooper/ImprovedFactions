tobero: 
What are the things you want in the next upate? I want to know, because I don't have much time and I want to add features most people on this server would like
.kyrenic: 
Outsider rank and overpower are the main things I'd like to see
ooo7: 
I want you to work with Vault
tobero: 
Vault... ywhat do you mean? The economy is already running through vault
ooo7: 
understood. I'll try
tobero: 
You need vault and an eco plugin (Vault - Essential, Vault -  iConomy) They some more are listed at the vault spigot page
tobero: 
These things are coming in the first release (v1.0) no beta.  This update will take a while to make (Making more cool extenions, adding a gui for the config and rewritting the plugin again to remove the last performance leaks)
tobero: 
Both are now implemented in the v1.0.
.kyrenic: 
POG
tobero: 
Overpower feature got now added to ImprovedFactions + a proper power system
dunr: 
less go!
tobero: 
Outsider rank is now out. Its called Guest. Every person not in your faction or allied is a guest. You can give them permissions to break, place and interactions
.kyrenic: 
Nice!
tobero: 
I know... it took very long but now I implemented it for the beta versions too
tobero: 
If someone wants to help me find bugs in the newest version, containing the performance upgrades & new claim manager.

You need to know:
- Not all commands from the BETA builds are currently available
- Extensions aren't a thing yet
- Old data isn't getting loaded (So don't put it on your server)
- Faction permissions are missing
- Most commands have missing descriptions (You get a long message in chat telling you that something is missing)

Most changes come to performance(Less RAM / Player), (stability), storage read & access time and lang files will automatically add missing translations (Always english, doesn't matter what file)

**No dependencies**

tobero: 
Update for ImprovedFactions optimised version

-Added faction settings gui

**Missing:**
- Extensions
- Many translateable texts (Shows localization error in chat)
- Typical commands (/f map, etc)

**Troubles:**
- When using `/f plugin disable` and you reload the server, server has bad tps

tobero: 
Do you want extension support next for the alpha version?
jokbon: 
first 1. fmap,
later 2. Mass claim extension 
later 3. placeholders & chat extension needed
later 4. dynmap
jokbon: 
after 1 , 2, 3 complete i will start using this plugin
tobero: 
alright
tobero: 
They will be added in the next update
jokbon: 
dont rush to dynmap first write how to use extensions and what they give
jokbon: 
or else they will be useles  yk
tobero: 
No worries. For this I have the beta version that tells me what not to do...
tobero: 
Added papi support. fmap comes next and aftre that the extension updates
tobero: 
After (too) many days working on the new faction modules (The way extensions can register new items to a faction json) I have finished it now.
So now all extensions will be rewritten for this version. Means: When you want to use extensions, please switch to v1 pre release 3, as soon as it comes out.
tobero: 
I have noticed that the faction save files are now bigger than the old ones

@[Dev] Tobero  do you have 5 min please ?
tobero: 
Yep
holadopa: 
can you go to our discord please ?
tobero: 
Of course
josh65: 
Does the plugin sperate essentals/vault money balances on faction worlds?
jokbon: 
no
jokbon: 
@Josh65
jokbon: 
(thats like imposible)
tobero: 
It does only create a bank for the faction. So it will interact but with it's own account
josh65: 
is there a way to disable or sync the money for all worlds as i dont want a seprate bank for the faction ones if possible and just use the players exsting balance
tobero: 
Best way is to just remove the permissions to use /f balance
tobero: 
But without faction economy extension the bank is useless
tobero: 
As it has no /f deposit, /f withdraw, etc
tobero: 
So without the faction economy, you won't have to worry about users depositing money there
tobero: 
What's the next extension you want? First three are form beta and last one will be new
üå∞  - Faction chest extension
üí∏ - Faction economy extension
ü™∞ - Faction fly extension
‚ú® - Chunk particle border
jokbon:

tobero: 
Looks like I'm gonna add the chunk particle extension
pvink7: 
i meen wan ar ju done whit biulding it wat doe ju ting?
tobero: 
I'm currently trying to fix the lang not found bug many people have
pvink7: 
o ju doe that first plz
tobero: 
Bugs need to be fixed before I can continue adding new features, because else no one is using the plugin anymore until I added all wanted features
pvink7:

pvink7: 
?
tobero: 
I think I'm finished
pvink7: 
ok
pvink7: 
plz doe @√ßlaim_gui  wan jure done
tobero: 
claim gui is already added
pvink7: 
‚ú® - Chunk particle border
tobero: 
Yes, of course
pvink7: 
is it online or in biuld?
tobero: 
No, I thought you meant the claim gui, not the border extension.
tobero: 
I'm currently working on it
tobero: 
So, I'm not sure about how you imagined the borders to work, but I would have implement it in this way (Not my images, just some random I found on google)

pvink7: 
cool can ju make it that there ar lines evre 10 block hicht
pvink7: 
and plz the pluging doanload
tobero: 
No
tobero: 
its not added. I just wanted to know if that would be how you would like it
pvink7: 
yes bhut ist whut be cool if there where more lines like 10 block up 1 more line
tobero: 
Yeah, but this would make the server performance and client render performance even worse
pvink7: 
o ten dont
tobero: 
ill give the link to the first version that works
pvink7: 
ok
pvink7: 
and?
josh65: 
could make it a client option for how high they go
tobero: 
Yeah, it takes time. I'm currently stuck with calculating the particle shape that should get followed.

tobero: 
Or do I get it wrong?
josh65: 
would those chage the block height too or just how many there are
tobero: 
only the density.
tobero: 
But you meant the height. So the height from the highest point on the world surface or whre it starts?
josh65: 
where it starts then how many block it goes up from there
tobero: 
Ah, okey
tobero: 
Yeah, can add it of course
tobero: 
Finally, I atleast managed to display the x lines for a single chunk

This is the current working version of the particle extension and the version you require to run it.

Feautures:
- Every chunk gets a particle outline
Missing:
- Setting to change resolution
- More config options
- Unclaiming doesn't remove particles in most chases
- Only new claimed zones get particles loaded
- Chunks don't form one single shape (They have particles around same faction chunks)
- Block place and break doesn't update the particle height

tobero: 
Yes, why not
jokbon: 
if u want to kill server add more things to move event üòÇ 
and if u want to kill brain, put old particle names from minecraft alpha, and make users choose those in config, but incompatibility with 1.19 is a must have XD

pvink7: 
And the collors ?
tobero: 
I'm currently focusing on reducing ram usage and making the cpu load less, so that the server isn't lagging and players don't get lag spikes while seeing the particles.

So, I haven't focused on colors, but they will be used before the first version released officially
pvink7: 
and can ju chance the pardikols form?
tobero: 
Yes. it's a config options under chunk_particle_extension.dust
tobero: 
I just choose the redstone particle, because it is like the image
pvink7: 
no i meen tru setting command so all player cna chose
tobero: 
Yeah, can add it. But config option will be the default value
pvink7: 
ok
tobero: 
This is the first properly, version that displays chunk border with particles. It currently doesn't have any differently coloured borders and only fancy performance option for players (There isn't a selector generally)

But there are some known problems, so hope that improved the performance when they got resolved
jokbon: 
lol on windows my tick time 0.500
jokbon: 
while on linux 3.785
jokbon: 
üòÇ  wtf
tobero: 
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
jokbon: 
i thought so
jokbon: 
but i moded my windows ngl maybe it impacted
jokbon: 
like removed lots of stuff and made win 11 use 700mb ram
tobero: 
I think, that it would make more sense for the extension to not run in the server, instead run on a client side mod, because my server has some serious issues with ram using the extension and round 4 Ms CPU time are getting lost with the extension.


That's why I was thinking of handling it with a client side mod. The mod would take over projecting the particles, so that the server isn't needed to take care of that.

Would someone still use this extension when a mod is required to display the particles?
jokbon: 
yes but there is some problems with ur current extension design
jokbon: 
add config option for particle distance
jokbon: 
if u want ofc
jokbon: 
yep mod gives more iq i agree
pvink7: 
Adding air
jokbon: 
tobero iama invite u to my server and show some particle things
jokbon: 
i let everyone on server use particles iam pro at it
jokbon: 
(and yes its server side aka uneficient thing)
tobero: 
There is already
leonzockt01: 
I would use it
tobero: 
Optimising the chunk caching process for the server sided chunk border extension, then I will be able to upload it to the public extension registry
tobero: 
Extension is now available using /f extension download
tobero: 
So, I got inspiration from three online templates and my friend. I'm no graphics designer, but if I would print this to an image and use it as spigot banner and website, would this be appealing for you, when you are looking for a faction plugin?

With the new version, v1.6, there will also be a updated spigot site, as 1.6 adds more user customizablilty, as example the actions, the config GUIs, 
As well as some bug fixes coming for faction pvp, the unclaimable zone, tnt cannons and auto world guard protection

jokbon: 
so i started to loose minerals like potasium realy fast
tobero: 
okay
jokbon: 
so sometimes after alot of work i get into this condition
I was moving 50cm by 50cm by 10cm concrete street tiles in my land which trigered it. I was consuming minerals on large doses, and i had nothing like that after 2016 only on rare cases
jokbon: 
i still nearly died, like i didnt owerwork i tryed to rest after each time wtf

jokbon: 
(also u would bitch each time abt stalcraft abt pvp which is totaly false lol, well atleast i didn waste my time on recent events since i cant do shit, i would spam memes on erodogan which is dumb) @TabbyMinecraft
jokbon: 
too much pc bad
tobero: 
can you please fight about your stuff in dms or another discord server? 
I think this is too off topic
jokbon: 
@TabbyMinecraft i have few minecraft advice for you tho üôÇ since there are so little plugins i found some replacement methods lol
tobero: 
**A bad version of the improved factions auto answer bot trying to replicate a normal conversation on this discord:**

PVink7: where could it to kind of the less Right and then out?
Tobero: Yep, I won't recemption that allows you start, as its any other guys many time when the probl√®me procks and modils in the updated I finuse. https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/improved-factions.java:93) ~[paper-1.18.8.jar:git-Paper-247]
ast metral? /f infin
jokbon: [ATTACHMENT]: what should i probrem all other factions? is the entire members is removed timeout from cconfustive chunk?
jokbon: thing my dayb doesn't work weird
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero what?
jokbon: 
????????/
jokbon: 
u mean there are human like virus bots?
jokbon: 
because of chat gpt?
tobero: 
I've trained a neural network on the chat history of this discord, trying to create a bot that can answer the questions people ask for instant answers (As well as in plugin integrated help)

I'm currently trying to find a way making more synthetic data (fake discord question & answer). I've also gathered data from many other discords needing a detox and anti spam.
jokbon: 
lol
tobero: 
No, It's not chat gpt. It's jsut based on the same technology. Training ChatGpt / Using their api would be to expensive for this discord
jokbon: 
tobero can you leave my yagpdb bot?
jokbon: 
and maybe those chanels
tobero: 
Why should I kick him?
tobero: 
Oh
jokbon: 
then who kicks?
tobero: 
yeah
tobero: 
Sure. I've never planned on replacing him / the channels. The bot right now is still getting screwed by gramma errors
jokbon: 
i think i shud make own server for auto ansvers then
jokbon: 
bc it keeps being removed
jokbon: 
u probaly hate when i do something
jokbon: 
cuz idk it keeps being removed
tobero: 
I've never kicked the bot / removed channels
jokbon: 
is there any other discord admin
jokbon: 
who kicks bots
tobero: 
Not that I know
jokbon: 
wait
jokbon: 
i know reason
jokbon: 
did u change perms of it?
tobero: 
Not that I know
jokbon: 
also
jokbon: 
one more question
jokbon: 
do you like the way u set the server more than i did
jokbon: 
i mean that support section that i made
jokbon: 
is it bad?
jokbon: 
too bloated?
tobero: 
I think it's missing the support community channel.
I think #üî≥‚îÇsettings is unnecessary.

But everything else is okay, it would reduce my support discord to only one
jokbon: 
i mean i plan that comunity
jokbon: 
settings is nescesary
jokbon: 
just setting chanel not finished
tobero: 
oh, okay. Then it's all good
jokbon: 
so  which setup u prefer
jokbon: 
ur own?
jokbon: 
just asking so i know the best way to provide for you
jokbon: 
btw tip never put slowmode in any chanel it breaks linux discord users
jokbon: 
that put image and text in same message
tobero: 
I think the one we currently have fits improved factions, but I would even more like it if we can manage to make this server not just for improved factions, so maybe try to update the current one, instead of making a hole new one.

I just think the one you designed feels a little bit cramped
jokbon: 
i see
jokbon: 
but its done so on purpose
jokbon: 
since if was extremely unstable it was hard to track bugs
jokbon: 
thats why its so
jokbon: 
when there was multiple reports ansvering one question made other questions become forgoten or misinpreted due flow of information spreading in scroll mess
jokbon: 
since users lazy to post in forums it became so
jokbon: 
thats my defense lol
tobero: 
Yeah, makes sense.
How about I'll just document every question, try to make it clear from the plugin side and if that's not possible, but it into a easy searchable forum?
jokbon: 
i wish to do that but i dont know some part of programing and dont have time to learn that
jokbon: 
it will break ansvers
jokbon: 
when i will have more time i will look into that
jokbon: 
.

tobero: 
Okay.... I've let this thing train even longer and I think I should be terrified. Here's the response:

Question: I need help
Response: Maybe me, your old partner, [Dev] Tobero, not any real human who should only look at what they really see, and now they might finally, see everything. You get what you paid for right?
tobero: 
Okay... the continuation of this response is even worse:

But maybe they shouldn't, ever get that lucky. Because its not every morning after going home and going back to support only for a friend on Factions to wake your plugin back up with this, you know... this dare (but mostly joke "yeah sure like you are going to post this?" Then maybe post them) * you're not that stupid so now you walk across all those people, through this bright red carpet, filled with help, you're so focused it's getting hard to remember where your members are, even if you could see them as a long gone memory
tobero: 
Imagine you just joined the server to ask for help and the bot is answering with this crap, like you did something wrong.
josh65: 
Have you look into a ChatGPT api/model to use, or is that one?
tobero: 
No, I'm not using their api, as I on't want to pay for every single request. I created my own 'ChatGPT'.


At first, I used a very simple RNN, one that generates letter for letter. The training data for the linked tries were just the scraped discord channels.

My second attempt was using Attention and Tokenisation (Basically, instead of predicting letters, it now predicts words). Because these things are currently the state of the art technology, needing a ton of training data, therefor a lot of time (ChatGPT as example had ~500Gb of Text and 300 Years of GPU hours) it would be impossible for me to train something like that.
But, I some weeks ago I heard of a new open source LLM, called falcon-40b, having the Apache 2.0 license (Meaning I can use it commerical and non commercial), pretrained one a huge training set, across multiple gpus (Costing extremely much money, See the attached images). I then used this model for transfer learning (I just copied the lower Layers of the model into my new one and fine tuned it to reproduce Q&A like conversations). The data I used for training this model not only included this discords chat, but chats from ~ 200 different big discords, filtered for profanity. I also let chatapi talk to itself using the api.

At the end I trained it for a ~12 hours on my computer. The results where... weird. But I found a fix to it. These outputs are being generated with a high temperature, a numeric value, where something near 0 means extremely accurate, with risk of repeating itself, while something close to 1 means being creative, at the risk of hallucinating (Just as the text above). In my case, the text response above has been generated with a temperature of 0.9.

tobero: 
I hope it's not too technical
jokbon: 
i agree with the bot xd
jokbon: 
its still wery helfull at saying "hey tobero just finish factions"
jokbon: 
lmao
jokbon: 
also
jokbon: 
nvidis only ai friendly gpu
tobero: 
Other gpus can be used too. Nvidia just has the gpus you'll have wet dreams about
jokbon: 
api incompatibility
tobero: 
Not really. AMD Gpus are supported by tensorflow, aswell as the ones from intel. 
When you want to count tpus, they're supported too
jokbon: 
lol
jokbon: 
intel cant copute minecraft
tobero: 
Yeah, but these things are still gpus usable by tensorflow. How much sense it makes using them is a different story
jokbon: 
brugh i want intel to make minecraft computable
jokbon: 
üò°
tobero: 
Their integrated gpus aren't as bad as they once were anymore
jokbon: 
they are bad
jokbon: 
but
jokbon: 
they have some low latency strangely
jokbon: 
perform better than amd at peak framerates
jokbon: 
which is impresing
jokbon: 
but they suck at any serious load while arc is exactly oposite
jokbon: 
i had igpu arc and radeon
jokbon: 
and nvidia
tobero: 
Yeah, they aren't designed for games, but they can handle more things than they were able to do before. 
When I look at the laptop of my grandma I'm glad to have a integrated cpu of modern standarts, not the one my grandma uses
tobero: 
I like nvidia gpus
jokbon: 
i kinda hate because have high refresh rate monitor
jokbon: 
amd gpus are perfect for high refresh rate gaming
jokbon: 
i beaten world record by startup time
jokbon: 
at some strategy game
jokbon: 
but later fucking alien beat me
jokbon: 
ram disk instaliation + amd gpu is big big fun
jokbon: 
trust me
tobero: 
I don't usually play games. Instead, I torture my GPUs to demanding computations, pushing them to their limits, especially with the bad fan setup I have
tobero: 
Mine aren't even capable of playing minecraft with more than 90 fps
jokbon: 
if u saiy i dont push to limit
jokbon: 
XD
tobero: 
No, I mean I utilise all of their cores, which is usually not done by modern games, outside of rendering.

world edit question
how do i range replace both air and blocks 
-.-
tobero: 
I have no clue. Don't use plugins to be true
jokbon: 
How to be unsucesfull: gitlab docker kubernetes travis teamcity microsoft azure  datadog docker slack ops genie snyk heroku runable zendesk jasmine omnidesk shipable ms teams keybase smartsheet and other bulshit that takes time from you
jokbon: 
ü§ì ü§ì
jokbon: 
bruh what a corporate bloatware i dont get it why people actualy use that shiiit
jokbon: 
jenkins decent tho, but still kindof bloat?
tobero: 
jenkins is useless when you use gitlab correctly. So lemme explain:
- Gitlab is the better github when you do open source stuff. It has better ci / cd (Automation for tests, deployment etc)
- Docker is usefull af. It allows me to define linux environments where all setup has already done, therefore no need to install stuff locally (For example, my minecraft server runs with docker, the databases run with docker, my ides get hosted by docker). This allows me to install stuff with a single click and remove ***ALL** files (Tem stuff, etc) with one click too, therefore no wasting my space with files I don't veen konw exist. 
It also pretty time saving, as a docker container will jsut work without a setup or something.
Teamcity Useful for automated tests in large teams (Where the tested code base in not just units tests, but a whole project scoped one where you need a whole machine to run it).
azure It's just a cloud host making it easier for your webapps to grow when user requests reach a high (and shrink whe not needed, therefore saving you a lot fo money)
teams is useful for meetings and team communitaction.

All other stuff... I don't know, but I think everyhing most devs might needs is covered with these few services
jokbon: 
its sometimes easyers to make app for own stuff
jokbon: 
ye its usefull
jokbon: 
but in the end waste time with changes
jokbon: 
especialy when bad comunications happen
jokbon: 
that sometimes can take more time than your project
jokbon: 
especialy love when using those services makes ur project bonkers
in the end from feature perspective it would look like this:

@[Dev] Tobero
jokbon: 
Hope it helps xD
jokbon: 
my mom is artish she even doesnt know those XD
jokbon: 
so dont worry if ure mistaken. dont take too hearth too much
jokbon: 
these mistakes are taken from "home depot" shops which specifies how long object is. 
They usualy mix up coodinates in theyr naming. Because how long is becomes height, since its most important to a costumer it gets specified first, but coordinates are specified:
X 
Y 
Z,
While home depots specify them incorectly as:
Y
X 
Z.
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero i think this is pretty important xD im smart, but i don't usualy think about everything. Sorry for not specifying this mistake earlyer.
tobero: 
Width right now is corresponding to the column count, height to the row count, isn't that correct?
jokbon: 
Incorect
but it also means that change will make me to rip my configuration XD
jokbon: 
but for sake of less brainfuck lets do it correctly
jokbon: 
you not only made me F|-|ck my head but also F|-|cked josh head where he couldnt find his mistake xD
jokbon: 
since you didnt folow the standart
jokbon: 
also i need to update mymodpack
