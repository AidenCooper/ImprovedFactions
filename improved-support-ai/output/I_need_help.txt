Looks like the plugin had issues starting. 
Have you seen any other error messages in the console?

If not, when does it occur? Does it get spammed?
mcsalmon: 
no i just get the above error message when entering plugin command
mcsalmon: 
HMMM

The java.lang.NullPointerException error usually occurs when you are trying to manipulate an object that is not initialized or is not fully passed into the method.

In this case, the error occurs at the line io.github.toberocat.core.listeners.PlayerMoveListener.OnMove(PlayerMoveListener.java:39), when the ClaimManager's getFactionRegistry() method accessing an object is not initialized.

To fix this, you need to check if the ClaimManager objects have been initialized. If it hasn't been started you need to create a new object and assign it to the Manager request variable in MainIF. You also need to check that the Chunk object has been initialized before accessing its FactionRegistry.

After modifying, you need to check again to make sure the error has been corrected

I just used gpt chat and it gave me the answer like this
tobero: 
Thanks. The manager doesn't get initialized due to an issue while initializing a different componet of the plugin.

The exception gets thrown when a player moves, so I don't think it's really an issue with the command (Unless the command caused this behaviour). That's why I'm asking.

If you want, you can also send me your log file, so I can take a look at it and search for indications of this issue (You can of course censor data you don't want me to see).

I found the cause of my lang file error some lines
tobero: 
Okay, so it's all good for you now?
