Channel: Add the faction name to a player in chat
Channel Type: GuildPublicThread

In this guide I'll tell you how you can put the name of a faction next to the name of a user in chat using placeholders.

**What you need:**
- ImprovedFactions, when you want to use the faction placeholders
- PlaceHolderAPI (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

- A plugin that customizes the messages players send. A example would be essentials.

```I'll go ahead and explain how you would do it with essentials, as it's probably the most commonly used chat formatter. ```


When you've downloaded all the required plugins, you have to start your server. Now you should see a folder in plugins that's named Essentials.
In there you should be able to find a file where a line says `format: //Stuff behind that`.

Now when you want to add the faction placeholders, you have to install ChatInjector, because Essentials doesn't support Papi out of the box. Here is the link to this plugin: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatinjector-1-13.81201/.

When installed, you can now edit the value for the property format.

When you now want to use placeholders, you can use them like you would normally, except you now have to replace `%` with `{` and `}` like the image shows below.

When you now send a message (And you're in a faction) your message should look like this.

The `Nexxt` is the name of the faction I created
`MateoSp5` is the player's display name
and `a` is the message that got sent.

You can now add more placeholders, like the `%faction_rank%` placeholder. You can find the hole list of placeholders on spigot.

jokbon: 
lmao kill it with fire
tobero: 
Why?
jokbon: 
bad compatibility + censor
tobero: 
Okay, didn't know that. I thought it's a decent guide. 
Would you mind correcting my failures?
jokbon: 
keep it for now
tobero: 
alright
jokbon: 
i will check other plugins if they got things done
jokbon: 
kinda new to this area, but that essentials are evil is no secret
tobero: 
Yeah, I hate essentials, but it's used on most servers
tobero: 
So I made a guide to get formatting for chat done with it
treblero: 
Sorry to revive this, is there a solution for a factionless player having the placeholder show in chat instead of being blank?

treblero: 
When I'm in a faction, the faction name shows fine
tobero: 
Oh... Yeah that's an issue. I'll add a config property for the default  value when the player has no faction. Will make a build in 4 - 5 hours if that's okay
treblero: 
Thank you so much!
