How do I raid a faction
tobero: 
Kill other faction members. When you killed enough members, the faction had lost enough powerso that you can go to one of their claims and over claim it, using /f claim
harutom: 
ohh
harutom: 
So I just need to have more power and step on one of their claims and claim it?
tobero: 
No, the other faction needs to have less power then chunks. Each death of an member uses 10 of their power by default. In one hours 1 power regenerates per online person (by default again)

But you need to have enough power to claim chunks, yes
harutom: 
oh, makes sense
harutom: 
thanks!

No problem

nguythanvu: 
everything is in default state
tobero: 
Yeah, the negative value is the faction power or the claims?
nguythanvu: 
I just edited here
tobero: 
If it's the power, that can happen
tobero: 
If it's with the claims, there must be something wrong with the unclaim handler
nguythanvu: 
Claims
nguythanvu: 
help me :v
tobero: 
Do you know what action you did? Did you use /f unclaim, or /f zone unclaim? Have you used the massclaim extension for doing this?
nguythanvu: 
/f claim auto?
nguythanvu: 
no
tobero: 
No, I mean for doing the unclaiming, claiming shouldn't cause negative values
nguythanvu: 
I think I haven't done it yet
tobero: 
Okay, will try to fix it
nguythanvu: 
tks bro
nguythanvu: 
hey bro
tobero: 
yes
nguythanvu: 
I think I know where the error is
tobero: 
okay
nguythanvu: 
if i claim then claim value will be 1
nguythanvu: 
but
nguythanvu: 
when i ulclaim then the minus value will be 2
tobero: 
okay, so you think it's because it subtracts 2 instead of one?
nguythanvu: 
yeah
tobero: 
okay
nguythanvu: 
Is that the default?
tobero: 
No
tobero: 
they are only for power management
nguythanvu: 
so now what can i do to fix it?
tobero: 
Wait until I have have time to fix it

fill this
Deleted User: 
is it possible?
tobero: 
You mean fill it as a claim or as with particles?

As a claim, just download the mass claim extension and use the wand like a worldedit tool where you select two points and select claim. This will probably lag a little bit with such a big selection, but it will work.

With particles this isn't possible. Even if it were, it would make your server unplayable

tobero: 
As the plugin says, it's in standby. I have explained it a little bit too bad, that's why there are many misconceptions about it.
tobero: 
Standby will usually kick in to protect your server when something went wrong with the plugin. To stop griefing, everything is getting protected
Deleted User: 
what should I do
tobero: 
But sadly, this is way too often the case for none serious things. That's why a simple /rl
tobero: 
should fix it again
Deleted User: 
ok

I reloaded the server and it fixed to me but my faction members still can't

Have you allowed them the place / break perms in the rank manager
Deleted User: 
yes
tobero: 
What rank do they have?
Deleted User: 
member
Deleted User: 
and i tried admin also
tobero: 
Check it in the member gui, maybe the standby got caused by a invite
Deleted User: 
I reloaded then it fixed, will it happen every time a player invite another players / join a faction?
tobero: 
Yeah, Inviting crashes the server with the version on spigot.

I made a version that fixes this issue, I'll send you the link to it

Deleted User: 
its shows that I claimed the chunk and I didnt
tobero: 
Yeah, that's why I said don't delete the folder for improved factions. It kept all references to the persistent data containers.

If the references are gone, the system will recognise them still as claimed because you haven't unclaimed them, just deleted the folder where dynmap etc kept looking at when it tried to render the chunks on the map.

You have some options:
- Use worldedit to regenerate the chunks, this will remove the persistent data, must be done by hand, for each previously claimed chunk
- Use /f zones unclaim to remove the data, must be done manually, for each previously claimed chunk
- If it's just a test world, save your seed and generate a new one.
- Restore the old folder and use /f admin reset

The plugin can't do much about it anymore (cause it's reference is gone)

tobero: 
You aren't using a dev build
tobero: 
therefore the new features don't exist
playbutton27: 
I Installed LuckyPerms, but it doesn't allow me to do the faction.commands.create command
tobero: 
Have you given the default group this permission and applied?
tobero: 
It
playbutton27: 
Wdym?
playbutton27: 
I did "/permission:faction.commands.create"
playbutton27: 
and there was an error
tobero: 
Use the web editor
tobero: 
/lp editor
tobero: 
There you go to default group and add it
tobero: 
After that press apply and it should work
playbutton27: 
I may sound dumb, but how?

Okay, so you don't have op, right?
playbutton27: 
I have gotten Op on it, and I can perform things, but my friends who are not op canot create factions et.c, and the commands are not working.
playbutton27: 
I am able to perform /f create et.c
playbutton27: 
but not Permission:faction.commands.create
tobero: 
And you are using luckperms for permissions?
playbutton27: 
yes
tobero: 
Then you should be able to use /luckperms editor
playbutton27: 
k, and after that in the web editor
tobero: 
Go to the default group
tobero: 
add the permission (You can do this in the bottom text field)
tobero: 
When you added faction.command.create you should press apply
tobero: 
But when you want the permissions to work properly, you should allow / disallow these permissions:

**Allow:**
```
faction.commands.*
```

**Deny:**
```
faction.commands.zone
faction.commands.admin
faction.commands.plugin
faction.commands.config
faction.commands.extension
```
tobero: 
The red marked fields are the ones you have to set for allowing / denying a permission

For allowing set the smaller field to true

Denying by simply setting it to false (See the screenshot I sent above)
playbutton27: 
the "Value" Tab?

tobero: 
Oh, okay. You mean dynmap isn't updating the chunks, right?
myddrim: 
It was kinda confusing at first. Something happened to the claims, so I had to use` /f zones unclaim`, at first to re-claim it. There were times when I logged in, I was not in my own Faction
myddrim: 
So had the typical, grief prevention on my own chest. This always happens when I had to use `/f zones unclaim`. Sometimes, I had to use `/f unclaim` for it to work. Not sure what's happening
tobero: 
Okay, that seems really weird. So the issue probably is, that the `/f zone unclaim` for zones is, which doesn't remove some faction claim trackers.

Usually, dynmap fixes itself after a restart (The website must be closed too to take effect)

If that doesn't help, you can try to regenerate your data, using `/f admin regenerate`
This will create the missing data / fox the broken one.
tobero: 
The issue with you not being in your faction sometimes is new to me, so when you encounter it the next time, could you take a look into the `ImprovedFactions/Data/Factions` folder, open your faction.json and check the member list. Tell me then if you saw your UUID (You can see your own UUID when joining the server)
myddrim: 
I actually did that. My UUID is in the member's line as it should be
myddrim: 
New error now, so with a restart on the server, my other member (who's testing with me) cannot open chests. I did not change the `/faction settings` so I'm not sure why they cannot interact with chests
tobero: 
Are there any issues in the console?
tobero: 
Okay, so there must be an issue with the loading of the faction
myddrim: 
just checked. nope
tobero: 
Can you do /data entity <tester name> and send me a screenshot of it? This could help me check if there's something wrong with the persistent data

Yeah, usually, for normal players only /f claim and /f unclaim should be used, as /f zone unclaim will do some stuff that is supposed to remove zones
myddrim: 
Let me remove the claims. Is there a faster way to clear the claims regardless of faction?
tobero: 
You can use /f admin reset
myddrim: 
What does /admin reset do?
tobero: 
It will remove all mess improved factions left behind
myddrim: 
okay. I've tried to disband the Faction, release the claims. - did not work.
I'm trying the /admin reset now
tobero: 
Okay, that's really weird
myddrim: 
`/f zones unclaim` did this to me several times

myddrim: 
Recall this problem? After doing /admin reset, I'm back to this stage
tobero: 
Have you tried reloading the server?
myddrim: 
yes
tobero: 
Okay, as sorry as I'm to say, I can't help with that. I can't fix the issues, because I don't have the old source code and as it looks, the core for claiming is broken, which can't be fixed without source code.

I think you'll be better of by using a working plugin, because until I can release the version I'm working on is server ready, it will take some time.

Sorry for the time you wasted. Sorry again for all issues this plugin has
myddrim: 
No worries. I'm planning to do a hard reset on the plugin options and try again. See if it works from there. I noticed why this problem all started to occur. I edited the /ImprovedFaction/Data/*.json file by changing the Description and MOTD. That's the start of this complicated mess
tobero: 
Yeah, but this shouldn't happen by editing something in the files (Unless you did it incorrectly, like removing a `"` or not escaping stuff like `\`, which I don't think is the case)
myddrim: 
I do know a basic knowledge of programming, so I can assure that syntax like that, I really make sure it stays intact
tobero: 
Yeah, so these things shouldn't kill anything
myddrim: 
Okay, I think I did a really hard reset on the plugins, err like by removing IF folder and .jar and everything else related
myddrim: 
It looks fine and probably won't be touching the Description/MOTD from now onwards. However, one thing to ask tho. In the `/faction settings` are the items in the GUI suppose to move?
myddrim: 
Something like that

tobero: 
No, I fixed in in his version
tobero: 
*this
myddrim: 
I'll update that in my next reset then. For now I've gotta head out to work then will play around with the settings more after this. Thanks so much (not gonna give up trying to get this plugin to work as it intended to be)
tobero: 
You're welcome. Hope the issues get resolved when resetting agian
myddrim: 
Mhm, when all else fails, reboot and start over :SharkPomPom:

Creating factions is not working
playbutton27: 
my friends (Who are not Operators on the server) can't do the /f create command
tobero: 
Then you have a permission issue
playbutton27: 
IS there any way I can add other players into the 'default' group
tobero: 
They are defaulted to this group, so there is no way for it
tobero: 
there has to be an issue with your permission layering

_jind: 
When I try to unclaim land in a faction it says NoLocalizationFound everytime and claims go negative
YAGPDB.xyz: 

tobero: 
The localisation is just that there isn't a message found that gets sent to you when using the command. this shouldn't affect anything.

When do they get negative? Instantly? Like you have 10 claims use it once and it turns to -1?
myddrim: 
So this is what I'm seeing every time my server restarts. I cannot interact with my chests within the claims. Any idea what to do to fix it?

YAGPDB.xyz: 

tobero: 
Yeah, that's telling you there is a error in the console
tobero: 
And this thing is the grief prevention, so even when someone crashed the plugin, they can't destroy anything
myddrim: 
I've removed grief prevention plugin from my server. The only one I have now is World Guard.
tobero: 
No, I mean IF has a anti grief system built in, so even when someone crashed IF, they won't be able to loot bases, etc. It has nothing to do with the plugin grief prevention, it's just how I call the system (Because standby mode is a rather useless name)
myddrim: 
So is there a way that this can be fixed? Cause it's happening a little too often and it can affect me too
tobero: 
Depends on the error you're getting
myddrim: 
on console?
tobero: 
yep
myddrim: 
How can I send you a .txt of the log on console? It's quite long
tobero: 
Usually there is just a latest.log file in the logs folder. Just send me that
tobero: 
Okay, seems like a issue with a faction file
myddrim: 
So by deleting the .jar it'll be fine?
tobero: 
no, if you want a quick fix, just use `/f admin reset`, stop the server, remove the `plugins/ImprovedFactions/Data` folder.

The longer one would require that you send me the corrupted faction file.
I also saw that the error gets originiated by the dynmap extension, so this might have caused it to not update. If there is no corrupted faction file, there could also be a claim in the world claim list, telling dynmap that there should be a faction for a claim, that doesn't exist anymore
myddrim: 
So the thing now is, even with these steps done, this isn't the first time it has happen. Ideally I don't download dynmap extension till this stablize?
YAGPDB.xyz: 

tobero: 
No, the extension doesn't cause the issue, it just causes the issue that it loads all things on server start, which tells what's wrong right way. If you didn't have dynmap extension, these things might be happening somewhen when nobody expected them
tobero: 
As I said, the issue is that a faction file isn't formatted correctly
tobero: 
To be exact, the issue is that the json parser expected a object closing tag, which wasn't found at the place it wanted it to exist
myddrim: 
so with /f admin reset, all players will be removed from their existing factions?
tobero: 
no, the entire plugin will remove it's data sorted directly into the nbt of chunks, players, etc
gunsnhemps: 
I am currently experiencing a problem with the plugin. the command /f relation allyaccept indicates that no invite was sent and or this command needs more arguments. The rest seems to be working fine so far. Can someone help me with this as I can't figure it out at the moment.
tobero: 
What's the faction registry you tried to accept?
gunsnhemps: 
Sorry, I forgot permission faction.commands.relation.allyaccept. Its working now.
tobero: 
Okay, you're welcome. Glad it works for you now
gunsnhemps:

What are the dependencies?

There are no depends
jokbon: 
Improved factions has home, particle, chat addons which dependency is improved factions itself.
Meanwhile dynmap addon needs dynmap and improved factions as dependency.

You can try turning off command description, I believe `/f settings` will have it. Its an issue with the code it will be fixed for 2.0.0 but there no current release time for it.
attractivemommy: 
okay thanks

/f settings doesnt have it, but its fine for now.

@sunrise it might be `/f user`
