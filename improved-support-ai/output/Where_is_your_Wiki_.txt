Channel: Where is your Wiki?
Channel Type: GuildPublicThread
Topic: None

cordlessdewalt: 
The WIki link on your site goes to  github folder with no wiki in it?
I love the sound of Improved Factions but I want to learn more about it? Commands? Permissions Nodes? Anything?

Yeah, the wiki right now isn't available without having run the plugin once. 
The best you can find right now are the module docs. For commands, their usage and permissions, you have to use /f help in-game. 
A little bit stupid of me, I'll work on a solution to generate these infos automatically into an readme file so you can view them without having to run the plugin
cordlessdewalt: 
that would be awesome, if I do install the plugin on a test server to check it out, where does the Wiki show up?
tobero: 
You can find the semi-wiki page by typing /f help. This will print a overview of the different command categories. Clicking on them will then further expad them and show the commands within this category
cordlessdewalt: 
awesome, I'll try it out, thank you!!
cordlessdewalt: 
Will you update it in your website when the Wiki information is live?
tobero: 
Yeah, I'll update the websites once the wiki has been generated. This might take some time, as this feature hasn't been implemented yet
tobero: 
Added a commands wiki: https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFactions_new/blob/main/docs/commands/index.md
