nitsuga10: 
I have downloaded the ImprovedFactionsV1.6.2.jar on an Aternos server as a plugin.
nitsuga10: 
and it says There went something wrong. If this happens more than two times, please report it to an admin. Error: NoLocalizationFound
YAGPDB.xyz: 

tobero: 
The localization isn't the issue, as this points out that the message is missing there.
I would need the error you get, because it's most likely a issue with the new Minecraft version
nitsuga10: 
im on the version 1.17.1
tobero: 
Hm, are there any errors in the console?
tobero: 
Have you considered updating to the latest version of this plugin?
nitsuga10:

tobero: 
Yeah, that's just a missing translation - Not pretty, but should still be functional
nitsuga10: 
nope
nitsuga10: 
and how i can make the map apper on the gui?
nitsuga10: 
btw i cant download the GUIEngine on Aternos
tobero: 
It should already be showing the claimed chunks
nitsuga10: 
yes but i need the GUIEngine on Aternos
tobero: 
Oh, yeah, doesn't it support modrinth?
nitsuga10: 
the software i use is Spigot/Bukkit
nitsuga10: 
can i make u a question that has nothing to do with the issue indeed?
nitsuga10: 
your name is tobias right?
nitsuga10: 
where are u from?
tobero: 
Yeah that shouldn't matter. Modrinth is just the site where you can download it. All new plugin updates go onto it currently, as it's more convenient for me, as I can upload files larger than 5mb
tobero: 
Right
tobero: 
I'm from austria
nitsuga10: 
ohh nice
nitsuga10: 
i tought u where from a spanish-speaking country
tobero: 
oh, how does it come?
tobero: 
because of my nickname?
nitsuga10: 
but i cant put plugins from outside the Aternos avilable plugins
nitsuga10: 
because of your name
nitsuga10: 
Tobias is also a name in spanish
tobero: 
I know, but  was just wondering if they suppor modrinth as a plugin mirror
tobero: 
Oh, nice.. Didn't know that
nitsuga10: 
whats a plugin mirror?
tobero: 
Just some website where devs post their plugins.

nitsuga10: 
i have other questions
nitsuga10: 
can i use dynmap on aternos?
tobero: 
Aternos can only download plugins from direct spigot links, which only support files smaller than 5mb - But the plugin got bigger in size, currently to 27mb just for improved factions
nitsuga10: 
cause dynmap plugin isnt available on aternos
tobero: 
I don't think so, as you'd need portforwarding
nitsuga10: 
yes i suppose it
nitsuga10: 
and which is the command to see chunck border particles?
tobero: 
If you want it, there are other free minecraft server hosts available people use as an alternative to aternos, because they allow file uploads directly
nitsuga10: 
nice, which one do u suggest?
tobero: 
If the extension has been installed, they should show automatically. If they don't you can toggle them in /f user if I remember correctly
tobero: 
I'm not sure, but I think they were called minehut or minefort
nitsuga10: 
k ty
nitsuga10: 
ok
nitsuga10: 
but there is no way solving the map issue on an aternos server?
tobero: 
The map gui? I suppose that it is broken, so the other option you have is to remove the map gui extension and go with the chat version of the map
nitsuga10: 
both of them are free hostings
tobero: 
Oh, really? Didn't know that
tobero: 
Thought that I just didn't remember correctly, as they sound similar
nitsuga10: 
i thought the same
nitsuga10: 
but there is no way to repair it?
nitsuga10: 
or without the guiengine it doesnt work?
tobero: 
The extension, I guess that is probably one. It's a pretty old extension (1 year or so), so it doesn't need GuiEngine yet. 
But as I've made a whole plugin rewrite in v2.0.0, I won't fix the old extension. The only thing that will happen is a whole new map for the new rewrite
nitsuga10: 
ohhh nice
nitsuga10: 
yeah i forgot im using the old version to avoid downloading the guiengine cause is not avilable on aternos
nitsuga10: 
its the v1.6.2
tobero: 
yeah, makes sense
nitsuga10: 
do u know any other map plugin avilable on aternos?
tobero: 
You mean something like dynmap? I don't think that this is even possible, as all those plugins host their own website, needing a free port
nitsuga10: 
nono
nitsuga10: 
i know dynmap is not possible for aternos
nitsuga10: 
no map plugins like journey map
nitsuga10: 
cause when i was choosing a faction plugin i was between yours, medieval factions and saber factions
nitsuga10: 
and medieval factions onlay offers dynmap which i cant add
nitsuga10: 
and saber factions i dont know
nitsuga10: 
thats why i choose your plugin
nitsuga10: 
cause i need the map
nitsuga10: 
beside of the faction
tobero: 
Yeah, you can try using the chat version of it, this will most likely work
nitsuga10: 
i know
nitsuga10: 
it works
nitsuga10: 
but the idea is to have a visual map for every player
nitsuga10: 
anyway
nitsuga10: 
if u want to join
nitsuga10:

tobero: 
I can't join right now, as I'm having a meeting in a few minutes with my team
nitsuga10: 
my MC server is going to be hosted on that server
nitsuga10: 
dont worry
nitsuga10: 
the server isnt open yet
nitsuga10: 
until i solve the map issue
tobero: 
oh, okay
nitsuga10: 
there u can read all the info about what is the server theme, rules, countries and everything
nitsuga10: 
ty
nitsuga10: 
have a nice day
tobero: 
Thanks, you too
nitsuga10: 
hi
nitsuga10: 
tobero
nitsuga10: 
i habe another question
nitsuga10: 
which is the command to see every faction created?
nitsuga10: 
and how can i give ranks?
tobero: 
Depends on the version of the plugin, but /f rank might be a starting point
nitsuga10: 
there is a /f faction list command?
nitsuga10: 
and can i be the owner of many factions, cause i cant create another one now that i have already created one
nitsuga10: 
the version is 1.6.2
tobero: 
No, as you can only be part of one faction, you can only be the owner of one
nitsuga10: 
but it says that, that command doesnt exists
tobero: 
There should be /f list
tobero: 
/f rank?
nitsuga10: 
so i cant create more to then give the ownership of the faction to another user, they must create the faction?
nitsuga10: 
yup
tobero: 
I'm not sure how the commands looked in v1.6.2, maybe it was /f set or something. I'd suggest scrolling through the tab complete list
nitsuga10: 
i did
nitsuga10: 
but there is not any similar command
tobero: 
Correct, only way would be if you're an admin user having permission to create factions for users, but again - You never are the owner of two factions
nitsuga10: 
which i could say it is this one
tobero: 
Ah, I think you have to open the member GUI for that
nitsuga10: 
im the owner of the server but anyway i cant
tobero: 
Like /f members
nitsuga10: 
k
nitsuga10: 
let me see
nitsuga10: 
now yes
nitsuga10: 
ty
nitsuga10: 
there is a full command list for v1 of the plugin?
tobero: 
Yeah, because it's a different command than create. As I've said, only one faction per user is possible and can't be outdone in any way
nitsuga10: 
im using the commands on this list
tobero: 
Not anymore, I removed it from spigot as it's been outdated for long now
nitsuga10: 
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/improved-factions.95617/
nitsuga10: 
do u remember the command?
tobero: 
Yeah, that's one the outdated
tobero: 
I think it was /fcreate or something
nitsuga10: 
some commands still working
nitsuga10: 
let me check real quick
nitsuga10: 
and to see every existing faction on the server there is a command?
tobero: 
Usually /help
nitsuga10: 
u mean /help o /f help?
tobero: 
/f help is a feature of the newer version if I'm correct, so just /help
nitsuga10: 
yeah
nitsuga10: 
from /help i get on /help ImprovedFactions
nitsuga10: 
and from that it only send one command which is /faction
nitsuga10: 
k doesnt matter
nitsuga10: 
ty anyway
nitsuga10: 
have a nice day
nitsuga10: 
remember to tell me if u want to join
nitsuga10: 
this is the theme of the server
nitsuga10: 
# THEME
üó∫Ô∏è THERE ARE 4 COUNTRIES YOU CAN JOIN PRUSSIA, BRITAIN, FRANCE AND AUSTRIA. EVERY COUNTRY ALREADY HAS AN ELECTED LEADER. YOU MUST JOIN A COUNTRY TO PLAY THE SERVER, TO JOIN A COUNTRY DM THE COUNTRY LEADER FROM THE COUNTRY YOU WANT TO JOIN.
üïäÔ∏è THERE CAN BE WAR AND PEACE BETWEEN COUNTRIES, BUT THAT WILL DEPEND ON THE DECISIONS THAT THE LEADERS OF EACH COUNTRY MAKE DURING THEIR GOVERNMENT.
üéÆ IT'S LIKE A GAME OF WORLDBOX BETWEEN FRIENDS IN MINECRAFT. JOIN, PLAY AND HAVE FUN.
tobero: 
I'll make it an issue on GitHub to make sure the factions can be created without any members, so these things are possible
nitsuga10: 
what do u mean?
tobero: 
It's just like a thing that reminds me of things I have to add in the next version of the plugin, like bug fixes or features
tobero: 
And I'll add the feature to v2.1.0 for empty factions no members, allowing for such behaviour your server is aiming for, as there might be other servers needing it too
nitsuga10: 
ohhh
nitsuga10: 
i understand now
nitsuga10: 
ty
nitsuga10: 
hey
nitsuga10: 
do u know worldguard plugin?
tobero: 
yep. I've heard of it
nitsuga10: 
do u know any command of that plugin?
tobero: 
not really
nitsuga10: 
k doesnt matter
nitsuga10: 
ty
tobero: 
you're welcome
nitsuga10: 
Tobero, it is possible to make subclaims inside a faction claim?
tobero: 
No, only one claim per chunk
nitsuga10: 
k
nitsuga10: 
ty
nitsuga10: 
but i mean sub divide the claim
tobero: 
Yeah, not possible
nitsuga10: 
cant invite someone to a faction
nitsuga10:
