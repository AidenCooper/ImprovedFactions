```Beta versions will no longer be supported```
I'm planning on removing beta version extension registry, as well as the working update checker.
With these files removed, the beta won't load anymore.

**Important for Server owners:**
If you are still using an beta version, this is the perfect moment to upgrade to v1, as this version is more performant, has more features, better guis, etc.
The old data will get loaded and reused, so there shouldn't get anything lost.

You have time until `1st August` to upgrade, else the plugin won't load anymore.

**Important for users:**
With this change, all servers using an beta version are forced to  upgrade. All servers where their admins/moderators/owners/players aren't active anymore, are likely to **not** get an update, meaning that you can't play on them anymore on 1st August

To make sure your server isn't affected by this change use /f version and check there isn't a beta in the output.
If it tells you there isn't such a command, you're already on v1 or later
