Topic: You have found some gamma errors in the plugin messages? Please report them here

henry_alden: 
For english:
"Wildness" (default/gaia /unclaimed faction) should read "Wilderness"
platypuspotato: 
my friends on a server i’m in really like this typo for some reason
platypuspotato: 
i asked if i should look for a way to change it and they said “no, wildness > wilderness”
tobero: 
It's no typo. I'm just "stupid" and didn't know how to write wilderness. But you can undo the change because you can set the title now your own
tobero: 
But I will remove It from the auto default config
henry_alden: 
English is weird
henry_alden: 
I promise my german is much worse than your English
tobero: 
That's probably because its much more difficult
henry_alden: 
When you "/f sethome" the output says 'suing' it should say 'using'
henry_alden: 
"/f info" description says "get a list of all your members + there ranks" --> Should read "+ their ranks"
tobero: 
Alright. Thanks for reporting
jokbon: 
/f info jokbon

katiedeforest: 
You're missing an R in "grammar" for your discord channel as well. Gramma is short for grandma. So grammar would be the correct term here. 😊

tobero: 
It looks like I'm useless... I can't even get the name for the grammar reports right 😅
katiedeforest: 
Haha, if you're not a native English speaker it's totally fair to make a few mistakes here and there. Nobody is gonna judge, we are all here to help 😊
katiedeforest: 
You help us, after all.
tobero: 
You are right. But I'm still kinda upset for having this error for like, one month and I didn't notice it
katiedeforest: 
We learn from our mistakes :shrug:
katiedeforest: 
I'm not a native English speaker either, but I'm bilingual. So languages has always been my strong suit. Especially because my partner is American.
tobero: 
I hate languages. I'm too stupid to speak German without making any mistakes in one sentence
katiedeforest: 
Ficken 😹
katiedeforest: 
Something like that
tobero: 
What do you mean...Ficken... we use Fuck too for this. Ficken means having a sexual intercourse with another person 😄
katiedeforest: 
Fuck 😹
katiedeforest: 
I don't speak German lol
katiedeforest: 
Only basic stuff
katiedeforest: 
Der fick
katiedeforest: 
😹
katiedeforest: 
Dieses scheissauto
katiedeforest: 
I can't make a double S symbol lol
katiedeforest: 
B
tobero: 
Yes. That would be right, if you talk about a specific time when you had sex with someone.
katiedeforest: 
Goddammit, I ain't talking about sex 😹
tobero: 
I think you write shit like this in german...
katiedeforest: 
Huh?
tobero: 
Ah.. I'm just stupid. You write it with ß
katiedeforest: 
Yeah, I know. I can't make it
katiedeforest: 
But thank you for the copy
katiedeforest: 
Omg I can't copy paste it either xD
tobero: 
Why?
katiedeforest: 
It converts it to a double s
katiedeforest: 
And just writes SS
katiedeforest: 
The struggles of a Nordic keyboard lol
katiedeforest: 
Æøå
tobero: 
Use this as replacement

Just the image
katiedeforest:

tobero: 
Yeah. That got already answerd here. It is something iconic for this plugin. But if you don't like it, just go to config.yml and set general.wildnessText to something else ('&2Wilderness' to get the corret message)
stevejwd: 
Oh okay, no problem. Thanks 🙂
katiedeforest: 
"Not give" Should be changed to "Don't give" 😊

Or "Do not give"
tobero: 
Ah, yes. A classic fail of the English demon inside me
jokbon: 
Iam plesed to are like that thx 
(I fixed own mistakes with a bot lul)
katiedeforest: 
"I fixed my own" 😹
jokbon: 
yes need to put My Ego higher thx
katiedeforest: 
Hehe
katiedeforest: 
When using /f admin disband and mark a faction with members in it. 
This "ember/member" typo, comes up.
Just a minor detail I wanted to make you aware of 😊

tobero: 
Thank you
katiedeforest: 
No problem!
katiedeforest: 
And I'm assuming the "&" isn't supposed to be there either when setting safezone pos2.

tobero: 
Nope. It's probably missing a color code character. Will try to avoid it in the upcoming versions
josh65: 
proberly should add sent before it the r too as "you have player an invite" doesnt make sense
tobero: 
Yes. That'd makes sense
jokbon:
