@[Dev] Tobero  tbh ur logo kinda anoying bc colors blend in, when it was scaled i could better see. maybe beter was to revert the change or change colors by pusing those inside of logo.

tobero: 
Yeah, will change it back
jokbon: 
lol ur faction plugin no worse than apache
jokbon: 
apache broken af
jokbon: 
runt into 4 diferent isusues
jokbon: 
üò¢
jokbon: 
what you think is broken with claiming?
tobero: 
I haven't encountered one, what where the problems? Maybe I can check if I haven been using them and that's the problem with claiming
tobero: 
That's the question
jokbon: 
hmm
jokbon: 
I would expect it to work like this but I have no clue, and it seems like chunks from other factions can't be claimed because of a bug
At least I couldn't do it
jokbon: 
i think there could be 3 diferent isusues
jokbon: 
you shud have asked user
tobero: 
they can't tell me where int the code my problem is, they can only say that something is wrong with it
jokbon: 
1. information mismatch
2. owerclaiming at diferent time
3. maybe there is block while it waits for something so it doesnt claim?
jokbon: 
i think i will add error handler to auto ansver
tobero: 
Alright. Would be very kind
jokbon: 
its easyer to implement cause values persist
jokbon: 
like wery easy update
jokbon: 
just posting this for myself ## error detection https://discord.com/channels/819932760550014986/881593704614350921/964184549280075896
work in progress
jokbon:

jokbon: 
ok bye
tobero: 
Alrightm thanks
tobero: 
I have claimed my one month free discord nitro and spent my boost for this server, because I have no other servers that I could boost. Just of someone wonders. I didn't buy them, just claimed by free discord nitro
jokbon: 
XD i wouldnt fall for free nitro scams
jokbon: 
later they will charge you if u dont cancel
tobero: 
I have cancelled instantly
tobero: 
So, it's no scam.
I did it with epic games free nitro for one month too
tobero: 
And I wasn't charged anything. I just cancelled directly after activation
