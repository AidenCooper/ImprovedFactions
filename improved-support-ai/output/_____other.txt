Community Updates: 
Hey Community Admins and Moderators, 

üïê  **Timeout feature is now live to all communities**

We're excited to share a better way for moderators to temporarily stop a member from interacting in their server! Members in timeout will not be able to reply, react, message or join voice for a set period of time. 

:dot: Only Members with `Timeout Members` permission can time others out. This is default-off, so **Owners+Admins will need to grant permission to others**. Go to "Server Settings" > Roles. 
:dot: Anyone can timeout another member with a role below their own if they have the permission. 
:dot:Members who leave and re-join the server will still be in timeout. 
:dot: Members in timeout need to upgrade to latest client version to see the time remaining in their timeout. You may need to manually update to latest iOS and Android clients. 
:dot:Learn more about this feature here:  https://dis.gd/timeout

Community Updates: 
Hello Admin & Mods!

Today, we have a new update for slash commands in your servers: **Permissions!** If you don‚Äôt know, slash commands are a new, easier way to use bots on Discord. You might already have some to use‚Äîtype `/` to find out!

With this new system, you can:
:dot:Control who can use slash commands in your servers
:dot:Control in which channels commands can be used
:dot:Sync or unsync commands like channels and categories, making mass management and special cases easy to handle

You can find these permissions in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Pick an app!** If the app supports slash commands, you‚Äôll see the UI.

‚ö†Ô∏è If a bot you use has integrated slash commands, the old way of denying the bot Read Messages **will not work to moderate commands usage.** You‚Äôll need to use this new system to control access.

Not sure if your bots support slash commands? Check out in **Server Settings ‚Üí Integrations**, or just **type `/`!**

Check out our blog post to learn more and see a detailed walkthrough: https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots

Community Updates: 
Hey Admins & Mods,

Beginning Wednesday, 6/1 we‚Äôre rolling out **Text Chat in Voice Channels** to Discord. With embedded chat in voice channels, your community can send messages, GIFs, links, memes, etc. to everyone in the voice channel‚Äîno more clogging #deleted-channel.

**We are rolling out Text Chat in Voice Channels slowly to all servers throughout the week. Initially, it will not be enabled by default for servers that have greater than 200 members or are set as a Community Server.**

But once you have access‚Ä¶
:dot: You‚Äôll have a new Server Settings tab on the web or your client called *Text in Voice*.
:dot: Turn Text Chat in Voice Channels on for your community by selecting *Enable*.
:dot: Customize permissions for your community, like enabling in specific voice channels or disabling for certain roles. Most developers of your favorite moderation bots have already updated their instances to monitor Text Chat in Voice Channels!

For more details on *Text Chat in Voice Channels*, read our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359

In four weeks, Text Chat in Voice Channels will be automatically enabled for all servers while still respecting your prescribed permissions‚Äîbut we recommend you enable it early for all your server members to enjoy!

**It‚Äôs Easy To Keep Your Community And Conversations Clean With AutoMod**

Meet AutoMod, your new best friend in moderation. Designed to reduce work and stress for moderators, AutoMod comes equipped with keyword filters to help keep your server clean and safe around the clock by automatically filtering out harmful or undesirable messages before they‚Äôre posted. Enjoy newfound peace of mind, even when you‚Äôre offline.

:dot: Receive alerts from AutoMod when members try to use words from your lists and assign actions like Timeout from the alert itself.
:dot: Add **Wildcards** to your keywords to detect variations of words that partially match those on your lists. 
     :bluedot: `bake*` ‚áí Today, we **bake**d some coffee cake
     :bluedot: `*milk` ‚áí I add soy**milk** to my coffee
     :bluedot: `*press*` ‚áí A Gibraltar is equal parts es**press**o and milk

Community Updates: 
Hey Admins and Moderators,

We've got an update on all things Community today!

If you haven't joined our Discord Admin Community‚Ä¶ what are you waiting for? Head over to **Server Setting > Community overview** and join us ‚Äî we've got a slew of exciting and fun stuff planned that you won‚Äôt want to miss out on.

ü™¥ __*Below is a sneak peek at the Stage events we‚Äôve got cookin‚Äô!*__

:dot: August 16th: Safety on Discord
:dot: August 25th: Utilizing Automod in your Community

To join our Discord Admin Community, your server will need to hit a few engagement requirements. Once your community reaches the requirements listed <https://dis.gd/DAC-FAQ>, any of your Admins or Moderators with the ‚ÄúManage Server‚Äù permission will be able to join the Discord Admin Community via Server Settings > Community.

üìö __**Community Resources**__
We recently released our Community Resources, a one-stop shop for learning how to build, engage, grow, and manage a space where anyone can belong. New articles, showcases, and more will be added in the future, so be sure to bookmark it for later. <https://dis.gd/Community_Resources>

If you haven't already taken a peek at some of our content, you can check out the latest video! https://dis.gd/H2M_Your_Discord_Community

ü§ñ **__Apps & Bots__**
If your server uses a **verified app**, the way you send commands has probably changed in the last year - if it hasn‚Äôt, it may very soon! Developers of verified apps have been migrating to Slash Commands. The deadline to finish migrating is the end of August, which means on Sept 1, any apps that haven‚Äôt finished may have reduced functionality.

If you haven‚Äôt tried out slash commands yet, type / in your server to see all the commands you have access to. If your favorite app isn‚Äôt listed, they may not yet have enabled slash commands. Or, you might need to check out the new permissions system in **Server Settings > Integrations.**

If you run across any issues, you can reach out to individual app developers to find out more. Learn more here: <https://discord.com/blog/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-discord-apps>

Hey Admins and Mods!

In our mission to help you keep your communities safe and lift some of that moderation work off your shoulders, we‚Äôve set our sights on helping you more easily detect and prevent spam and raids. Today's spotlight introduces new features that help keep your communities cleaner from spam, and a preview into our early plans on building tools to deal with raids.

:automod: **Keep your Community clean from spam with new AutoMod spam filters**
We know dealing with spammy messages sucks. If *only* there was a way spammy messages could be blocked from being posted in your channels and threads in the first place‚Ä¶ 

Thankfully, every community‚Äôs best friend in moderation - **AutoMod** - just got buffed with some new spam-cleansing abilities. Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod** to save hours of moderation work with these new filters:
:dot:**Block Mention Spam** - Detect and block mention spam and mention raids before they happen to keep chat clean and prevent members in your community from receiving annoying mention notifications and ghost pings. Set your own limit on the number of mentions a message may contain (up to 50). 
:dot: **Block Spam Content** - Detect and block messages containing text content that has been widely flagged as spam by user reports. Great for blocking unwanted spam like those pesky free Nitro scams, unsolicited advertisements, and invite spam that disrupt your Community's friendly conversations and game nights.
Check out our updated AutoMod FAQ help article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ

**Our early plans and progress to protect communities from raids**
We know being raided is one of the worst experiences you and your Community can go through which is why we‚Äôre giving you a heads up that we‚Äôre exploring ways to better detect and prevent raids before they take place, while making it easier to de-escalate a raid when they do happen.

While we‚Äôre in the earlier stages of progress here at Discord Labs‚Ñ¢, rest assured we‚Äôre eager to equip you with effective tools to more easily deal with raids as quickly as we can. So what can you do now?
:dot: **Report Raids**: You can now directly send us feedback reports when a raid is taking place in your server by going to your Server Dropdown and selecting Report Raid. If your Community is being raided, we encourage you to partner with us in our moderation efforts by reporting the situation as we‚Äôll be regularly reviewing your raid reports to develop tooling that combat raids. 
:dot: **Pause invitations** to your Community at anytime - You can now pause your invite links for when you want to temporarily prevent people from joining your server without having to revoking your invite links or vanity URLs - just head over to **Server Settings > Invites**. 
Because this cuts off the flow of new arrivals, you'll have an easier time halting a raid in progress. It also lets well-intentioned community members trying to join know that the stoppage is temporary, and that soon, they‚Äôll be able to come back to the same link and try again.
Learn more about pausing invites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8458903738647

**How we‚Äôre protecting communities from suspicious links: **
To help y‚Äôall with the legwork in dealing with messages containing malicious links, we‚Äôve buffed every Community server with a proactive suspicious link filter designed to detect and block messages containing links that are verified to be harmful, such as those leading to malware or phishing sites that try to steal people‚Äôs personal or financial information. We‚Äôll be continuously working on identifying links that might mislead or redirect users by reviewing a regularly updated list of unsafe and phishing websites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7326747355159-Why-was-my-message-not-delivered-

Hey Admins and Mods,

Y‚Äôall ready for some of that ~ juicy ~ product news?

After a bunch of testing, we‚Äôre excited to begin rolling out Forum Channels across Community servers!

Forum Channels are a new type of channel that provide a dedicated, organized space for conversations. Since conversations are contained in individual posts, your members can browse topics before jumping in‚Äîwithout worrying about breaking up or getting in the way of other on-going conversations.

If you‚Äôve been waiting for this news in anticipation and are ready to dive right in, go right ahead and click that Create Channel button. You should see that forum channels are now an option for you. If it‚Äôs not, you may be part of a small group of users who will have to wait just a little longer. (:soontm:)

Want to do a bit more deep thonking and research around how to best use Forum Channels before diving in? The following article on our Community Resources site will guide you on your journey to reaching forum Valhalla: <https://discord.com/community/creating-value-with-conversation>

Hey Admins and Mods,

Beginning on March 31, over the next several weeks we will start to roll out a new feature called **Soundboard**. This feature will let users upload custom short sounds to their servers, and then use those sounds to communicate in Voice Channels. 

Click here to learn more about soundboard: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12612888127767-Soundboard-FAQ#h_01GTYZSTZQV1GXSRVX1A420WPX>

To help you keep your server safe, we have already released some new permissions around Soundboard. You can now access and configure these permissions directly from Server Settings:
- **Use Soundboard:** Determines who in your server is able to use soundboard.
- **Manage Expressions:** Determines who in your server is able to upload and manage sounds.

Visit the help center article linked above to read more about Soundboard permissions!

Peace and Love,
Discord Team

Hey Admins and Mods,

Since 2015, every Discord username has been cAsE sEnSitIvE and had a number attached to it called a discriminator (e.g., #0001). This lets you have the same username as someone else as long as you have different discriminators or different case letters. However, this also means you have to remember a set of 4-digit numbers and account for case sensitivity to connect with your friends.

‚ú®**We wanted to make it easier for you to identify and add your friends while preserving your ability to use your preferred name across Discord. So, we are removing discriminators and introducing new, unique usernames and display names.** ‚ú®

üí† **New usernames** are lowercase, alphanumeric, limited to certain special characters, and do not have discriminators, making them easier to remember, read, type, and share. Now, rather than having to remember ‚ÄúPhiBi#8936,‚Äù you just say ‚ÄúI'm phibiscool‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. Your new username will be unique to you, and when friends try to add you there won‚Äôt be any mistakes of the wrong discriminator or incorrect letter casing.

üí† **Display names** are what‚Äôs shown both to your friends and in communities. Think of them as server nicknames that work globally across Discord. You can change it whenever you want, and it can be whatever you want, including special characters, as long as it follows our Community Guidelines <https://discord.com/guidelines>. If a username you were eyeing gets taken before you can claim it, no worries ‚Äî you can still use it as a display name.

üì© __When you‚Äôre eligible to change your old username and claim a new username, you‚Äôll be notified in-app. The older your Discord account, the sooner you will become eligible to pick a new username. üì©__

Visit our blog <https://discord.com/blog/usernames> to hear from one of our founders about why usernames are changing. To learn more about usernames and display names, check out our Help Center Article <https://dis.gd/usernames> for all the details.

Hey Mods and Admins,

**We're here with an update to make it more clear how we categorize the different types of servers, how to recognize them, and what you can expect in those spaces.**

üí† **Friend Server**
__*Friend Servers are invite-only spaces designed to discuss, connect, and share with your friends or smaller groups.*__ Invite links in Friend servers will expire at a maximum of 30 days, though previously created non-expiring links will remain active and functional.

*Friend Servers who wish to have access to Community features <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server> may opt-in to become a Community Server at any time in server settings.*

üí†**Community Server**
__Community Servers are spaces designed for people to share, connect, and learn from others all over the world who share common interests.__ Moderators in Community Servers have access to tools like Server Insights, Raid Protection, Rules, and Onboarding.

*Becoming a Community Server does not mean that anyone can find or join your server. Prospective members have to be sent an invite link.*

üí†**Updating Server Badging** 
In order for users to know what type of server they‚Äôre in, we‚Äôve introduced badges for Community Servers.

We will display a distinct server badge if the server is a 
* Community Server
* Discoverable Community
* Partnered Server
* Verified Server

Hovering over the badge will provide more detailed information about the server type, whether anyone can join the server, and the Boost level. Communities that previously had the ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù tag will now have a ‚ÄúDiscoverable Community‚Äù badge (denoted by a globe).

For more information on our approach to safety across server types, please visit our Safety Center. <https://discord.com/safety/360043709612-our-policies>

## Server Guide is coming to all communities

**Server Guide**¬†is a dedicated space within your community that points members to essential parts of your space and encourages them to participate. Many admins who have already set theirs up are¬†__seeing big bumps in member engagement.__ :nitroup: 

__Here are some of the features in the Server Guide that might boost your member activity.__
‚û°Ô∏è **Welcome Sign**: A custom message from you to new members, placed at the top.

:star: **New Member To Do's**¬†3-5 next steps for new members that get them talking and participating in your community.

:star: **Resources**: Declutter your server by turning read-only channels into fancy, easy-to-digest pages with images you upload **__(so make sure to upload an image) __**Another perk: Members land at the top of these Resource pages instead of the bottom of a message thread, and message bars and avatars are removed so it looks cleaner. Otherwise, your content, embeds, media, and formatting stay the same.

## That‚Äôs not all. 2 more updates to make moderation better!

ü§ñ **Automod for Profiles**
Sometimes bad actors set their display names in a way that breaks the rules. Automod will allow you to block specific language in a member's profile, preventing them from interacting with others in your community until they update their profile.

üö´  **Remove Reactions by Emoji**
Instead of removing all reactions from a post or individually deleting them, you can select the emojis you want to remove.

# Discord Communities are Getting a Safety Buff ü¶∫

Today, we're rolling out **three** new features that will help you keep your communities safe from DM spam and raids: **Activity Alerts, Security Actions, and a revamped Members page**.

## Activity Alerts and Security Actions
**Activity Alerts** will notify you of abnormal server behavior, particularly massive raids or unusual DM activity. From there, your team can investigate further and take further action to protect your community as necessary. If it doesn‚Äôt seem like an issue, you can easily mark it as safe. 

**Security Actions** allow swift server lockdowns by surfacing useful tools quicker, helping halt new member joins or aiding in closing off DMs between non-friend community members. Current Security Actions include:
- **Pause Invites**: Stop new members from using any invites to join the server. Experienced moderators may know this one already, and now it‚Äôs more easily accessible.
- **Pause DMs**: Temporarily stops new DMs from being sent between members in the server. This excludes friends DMing each other, when moderators DM server members, or DMs from Apps.

## Members Page
Previously tucked away in Server Settings, the **Members page** is used to find specific members, display members with a specific role, and even help you prune inactive members. 

Now, the Members page is in a more easily-accessible spot above your server‚Äôs channel list. And it‚Äôs been reimagined, letting you view your members in a more organized manner.  It now displays relevant safety information about your members:
- **Join Date**:  See when they joined your server.
- **Invite Link**: See which invite link they used to join your server.
- **Account Age**: See if they‚Äôve been on Discord for a while or are a new user.
- **Signals**: Appears if someone may have been engaging in unusual DM Activity, or flags a member you‚Äôve timed out. Use this to easily filter and find members who might require additional action or review. Over time, we plan on surfacing additional relevant Signals.

All of these new features work in tandem to provide mods with the helpful information and actions needed to help squash DM spam and thwart raids. We‚Äôre committed to improving safety on Discord by empowering and equipping mods with more tools to help protect your servers from harmful disruptions. It‚Äôs a never-ending journey, so stay tuned‚Äîthe best is yet to come!

For the details on how to use these new tools, check out the following articles in our help center:

üëÄ  What's that tag?

Hey Admins and Mods! Starting May 15, it's possible you might notice something new next to some of your members' usernames: ‚ú® **Guild Tags **‚ú®

See a cute little tag next to a member's username or profile? That's a **Guild Tag**, which indicates someone's membership to a chosen Guild. You can click on this tag to see the Guild profile, and even apply for membership there as well. What this means for you, beloved Admins and Mods, is that if your server's AutoMod is on, it will also check for Guild Tags ‚òëÔ∏è 

**What's a Guild?** It's a small, exclusive server that members can apply to join. These servers are tight-knit communities where members can relish in shared identities, hobbies, play styles, and more! 
> Please note that Guilds are only available to a small number of servers at this time, so not every server has access to this experiment. Additionally, our support team cannot manually add servers to this experiment.

Much love,
The Discord Team
