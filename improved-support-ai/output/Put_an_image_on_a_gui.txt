.erdavvo: 
i want create whit this plugin a gui like this
.erdavvo: 
is possible?
josh65: 
No
grapewithagun: 
it is but you need to create a server-side texture pack that edits the font so it displays the texture, which can be done but isn't easy
jokbon: 
not with this plugin but yeah its posible while still using if
jokbon: 
with gui engine u can create gui
jokbon: 
with resourcepacks and other stuff u can paint it
tobero: 
GUI engine supports it, you have to enforce a custom texture pack and tell GUI engine to open a GUI using this yextur
