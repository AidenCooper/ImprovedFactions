Delete langauge files before updating! Or update them manualy.
You can see which language files getting added. 
```[ImprovedFactions] Missing base.exceptions.arg-is-no-player in the language file for en_US
[ImprovedFactions] Missing base.exceptions.arg-is-no-player in the language file for en_US```

I also suggest to delete the guis folder, as guis get updated frequently
