7. Direct messages to jokbon won't make ansvers/support faster so don't.  It will only bring more confusion and slower ansvers. It might be posible that if i dont have time i will just close dm and your question will be lost. Asking on this server will make your question stay there, and if i dont provide support and you see me talking elsewhere it means i cant ansver your question.
