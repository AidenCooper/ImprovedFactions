Channel: ðŸ”µFeature: Power, Raiding & Overclaiming
Channel Type: GuildPublicThread
Topic: None

tobero: 
@Beta Testers I'm about to implement these features in the new version of improved factions, but I'm still unsure about how things should be implemented, to be the most straight forward to users, especially when it comes to power.

Power is directly coupled with raiding and overclaiming, which makes it so important to get right. In my optional, I always messed up with the power system in all previous versions, why I wanted to ask you about your ideas about it. Please leave them in this thread.


My current idea for the implementation would be to have a faction max level of power, which can be reached. This maximum increases with the amount of members you get. Each active member produces x power per x time unit. When a player dies, the faction loses x power. Claiming costs power too, but it only consumes the available power, which will regenerate, meaning factions can claim infinite chunks if they have enough time, but there comes the other thing into play: Each chunk has a base consumption of power, reducing the amount of power a faction gets in x time unit. 
As soon as a faction can't cover their chunk power consumption, protection at the outer chunks gets removed, making it vulnerable to raids. If a faction has no power at all, it'll be vulnerable to overclaiming.


That's just what I thought might work. Any other suggestions / refinements to my idea?
josh65: 
I think there should be a server configurable max total claims. So it can't be infinite making it more fair for new players.
jokbon: 
Death removes 2 power
1 hour adds 1 power
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you can raid if: (power - claims = positive power) = your power > enemy power
claims raidable if (power < claims)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if `(power < claims)` = true and `your positive power > enemy positive power` = true
then raidable
josh65: 
The amount of power gained and remove for an action should really be server configurable not locked values.
josh65: 
Maybe could also only give power when there players of that faction online or speed it up. That way they have to actually play to make progress but not lose any.
jokbon: 
2 ppl online = double power gain?
jokbon: 
instead of 1 person
jokbon: 
nah
jokbon: 
i dont like this
tobero: 
What about people using alt accounts?
jokbon: 
theyr toaster burns x2
jokbon: 
xdd
josh65: 
How about one of the faction members have to be online to start gaining power and if no one is on then they just say were they are.
jokbon: 
if more than 25% of members were not online for 2 days, then each of they decrease factions total power by 10 each day
jokbon: 
nvm
josh65: 
That just seems more complicate.
jokbon: 
nonono
jokbon: 
it fixes alts
jokbon: 
each alt - 10 of power
jokbon: 
instead of removing bonus they provide
jokbon: 
if alt sits at 7 power
then when inactive it will do -3 of power in the end
josh65: 
What if only 1 of 5 actual member were on. Then it would loss them power when they might not be able have every one on at the same time
tobero: 
Oh, power should be per player and not per faction?
jokbon: 
power is per player
jokbon: 
but afk alt penality is per faction
jokbon: 
if faction got alies
jokbon: 
it counts 1+ aliance counts as 1 member
tobero: 
Factions will have allies as I said, but I'm not sure about the war relation, as it was just unnecessary in most cases
tobero: 
Okay, so inactive allied faction => 1 Inactive member?
jokbon: 
yes basicaly it will force guy to log in with 2 acounts every 2 days
jokbon: 
which is kinda anoying
jokbon: 
it permits alts but punishes on alt abuse
jokbon: 
maybe too complicated
josh65: 
It would also do it to all player which can also be annoying if they can't log in every 2 days
jokbon: 
easy solve problem
tobero: 
Don't worry about complexity yet
jokbon: 
disable aliance
josh65: 
Wouldn't you have to be kick/leave and join the faction every time then, also can't do it if your the only member.
jokbon: 
Without aliance
XOOO = PASS
XOO = PASS
XO = NO PASS
X = NO PASS

With aliance
XXOOO = NO PASS
XXOO = NO PASS
XXO = NO PASS
XX =NO PASS
tobero: 
Am I the only one not getting it?
josh65: 
Im not either, I think just having power controlled as a faction and not per player would make it easier to understand and then just only let them gain power if at least 1 member is online
jokbon: 
it will restrict small factions from having aliances
jokbon: 
cause people make small factions with aliance and alt that to crap
jokbon: 
if u fear something just push percentage to 34%
tobero: 
Which percentage?
josh65: 
It might be better for the server to try limit the alt in general anyway. Some people probably would have alts depending on where they are like friends house and there own so there could be an issue of being stuck at the same power level or losing it constantly for 1 of the 2 member not being one for a long time.
jokbon: 
this
tobero: 
Btw, I think I might be able to detect if someone is alting. I can just check if two separate players connect from the same IP
tobero: 
Why lose power? How about just using a boost? Each online member boost sthe production by 25% percent (As discussed earlier)
josh65: 
Issue with that is if they have family play a faction as they would all have the same IP
jokbon: 
or 41%
jokbon: 
ye 41% better
jokbon: 
as i said need to do calculations
jokbon: 
since i didnt calc stuff yet
tobero: 
That's true.
jokbon: 
41%:
Without aliance
XOOO = PASS
XOO = PASS
XO = NO PASS penality given
X = NO PASS penality given

With aliance
XXOOO = PASS
XXOO = NO PASS penality given
XXO = NO PASS penality given
XX =NO PASS penality given
jokbon: 
note that this is penality of offline player, online players will not notice anything
josh65: 
How would a faction lose power then?
jokbon: 
it will just make days harder of factions with 1 or 2 or 3members
tobero: 
Player deaths maybe and chunk claiming. Each claimed chunk consumes a inital claim power (% or something else from config) and then each time power gets added, chunks consume again (This time just base power, 2 or something).
This would make factions overall receive power until they hit their max power cap, defined by the amount of players they have.

At least that's how I would've done it
tobero: 
Ah right. They still exist. What would help them then?
jokbon: 
it will limit amont of alts players can have
jokbon: 
there wont be afk alied bases with 1 or 2 or 3 members across the map
jokbon: 
it will need 4 to do that
josh65: 
Oh i was talking about it being and issue based on the reply i linked. My idea was to just have the faction not gain any power when there isn't anyone on. Saw that was in the initial plan anyway.
jokbon: 
wont afect anything
tobero: 
It will
tobero: 
I agree with the idea that factions might only accumulate power when members are online
josh65: 
I think you should do your initial plan then everyone can see how it works in game and then go from there. Should also add a max total claims.
tobero: 
Max total claim will be implemented
jokbon: 
thats true but
jokbon: 
i thought speach was about alts
jokbon: 
xd
tobero: 
Yeah, it kinda was at some point
tobero: 
Okay, after this small discussion, I would implement the power like this (All inlined values will probably be configurable):
- Each **faction** (Not player, for simplicity reasons) has power. It ranges from 0 to 10.
- Each member a faction gains brings a change to it's power. The increase of power will be calculated on a base value. like 50. Then, this base value will get multiplied by a factor of 1 over the current member amount.
**Example Log:**
FactionMax Power: 10; 1 Member
New Member: 10 + 50 * 1 / 1 (last member count) = 60
New Member: 60 + 50 * 1 / 2 = 85
New Member: 85 + 50 * 1 / 3 = 102 (When adding, ceil)
Left Member: 102- 50 * 1 / 3 (member count - 1) = 85 (When subtracting, floor)

**Why?**
This tries to help smaller factions. When for example the third member joined, it gained the faction 17 max power, while when the 20th member would have joined, it would have gained the faction only 3 max power. This drop-off can be configured.

- Each online member accumulates the their full power potential. Additionally, to motivate factions to play at the same time, there will be a boost at the power accumulation based on the amount of people that have taken part in the accumulation. All members counted as inactive (Last seen 7 days or so) will have a negative effect on this accumulation. 
This is forgiving for players that just can't login daily, but will still punish alts / inactive players.

- Claiming a chunk costs a faction power. The more chunks a faction owns, the more expensive the chunks get, controlled by a constant in the config. This should help factions value their chunks if the max chunks is set to a very high number.

- When a faction accumulates power, their allies will receive a small fraction of it. This will help control the amount of allies being formed. Too many allies and you won't have any power left for yourself. Not the right allies / not enough and you'll have major disadvantages in combat.

**Overclaiming & Raiding**
tobero: 
- Claims will get unprotected when a faction can't afford the base claim power cost. This means when they have more claims then they have power. The chunk will be raidable by **everyone**. Once a chunk is no  longer protected, factions that are in war with this faction can start the overclaiming process.

- Overclaiming will work by having someone of a faction you're in war with stay in your chunk for x time units. This makes sure that the enemy faction has to "capture" the claim before overclaiming it. This also prevents them from overclaiming in such a short time, that the other faction had no chance to defend their property.

- Allies can offer help by sending power. This is just a idea I had right now, but maybe that gives allies another purpose to exist




So, what you think about it? I tried to implement most of the ideas I read in this channel and combine them in something that makes sense for me. Please leave some feedback, as I'm not sure about most things.
I'm also not sure how players will get introduced into the system
josh65: 
Sounds good to me
