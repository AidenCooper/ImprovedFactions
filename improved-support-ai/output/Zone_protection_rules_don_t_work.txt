tobero: 
I'll be checking it at the weekend, I'm busy right now
jokbon: 
josh you can use it with world guard for now
jokbon: 
so its still "usable" i think no quick action needed for this
josh65: 
Yeah, I'm currently doing so.
tobero: 
Still, even though there's an alternative, it's not optimal
tobero: 
Tried to reproduce it, but I haven't been able to get this behaviour. I can't break any blocks in the safezone.
But the monster damage property is confusing. Right now, you can only prevent monsts from being damaged. Due to this limitation, I now changed the damage properties to allow both sided prevention. You can now prevent monsters from damagin the player and prevent the player from damaging monsters
