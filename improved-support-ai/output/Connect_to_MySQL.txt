stevejwd: 
Is it actually possible to connect to a MySQL database? I can't find any information about connecting to a database.
tobero: 
Short answer: **Not yet. You'll have to wait for v2.0.0**

MySQL is a feature that'll be coming to the new version.
In the current one there is a way to connect, but the problem with the current implementation is that it won't store all data needed in MySQL.
stevejwd: 
Ah, okay. No problem
