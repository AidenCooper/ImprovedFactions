Topic: You have good ideas that will improve the plugin? Post them in this channel and they will be added maybe

cr4nkybobbyhd: 
Hi so i have stumbled upon this plugin while searching for a factions plugin that isnt completely bloated with unnecessary stuff, it looks pretty good so far.
So i wanted to suggest maybe a dynmap addon or any other implementation so people can see their Faction on the map.
tobero: 
I was having in mind to do something like faction chunk boundaries showed with particles. But I could also try adding a dynamo addon
.kyrenic: 
Could you make the standard open type of a faction not public?
.kyrenic: 
So people would have to be invited
tobero: 
I think I have already added this.
.kyrenic: 
Pleas remove explaining the command in chat, it really spams the chat and isn't all that usefull
tobero: 
There is already a config setting
tobero: 
Go to config.yml and set general.commandDescription to false
.kyrenic: 
Hmm cool, might want to set it to false on install
tobero: 
I can do this when a /f help command works
tobero: 
But currently I'm too lazy to make the command
.kyrenic: 
Could you add outsiders to the rank permissions?
tobero: 
I'm sorry, but I don't know what a `outsider` is. Can you please explain it? Sorry for my stupidity.
.kyrenic: 
Someone not part of the faction
.kyrenic: 
Like maybe I want people who aren't part of my faction open doors to look around my faction territory
tobero: 
Oh. I can add this. That should be easily done
.kyrenic: 
Oh and another thing, a command to remove an extention, would that be available? Or is that too hard because it's already loaded in and all that jazz?
.kyrenic: 
Hmm and maybe a command to update an extention, unless that's what refresh does
tobero: 
I would need to rewritte the class loader. I can do it oneday, but First I want to make the plugin sort of "finished" (Server ready)
tobero: 
Refresh reads the file from the internet. I could add the command update
.kyrenic: 
Alright cool stuff, you're really receptive to ideas and active in replying, that's awesome :D
.kyrenic: 
Oh and maybe a command that lists currently installed extentions
tobero: 
I think I should have added it with the entir extension system. I will add it.
.kyrenic: 
A command like ``/f unclaim all`` would be very handy
.kyrenic: 
A faction warp system.

This would allow someone with the permission to set warps to set warps for members with the permission to use warps to teleport to. I'd suggest adding this as a seperate extention or as an addition to the home extention. These warps are per faction, each faction has its own list of warps.

It would have the following commands:
- ``/f setwarp (name)``
- ``/f delwarp (name)``
- ``/f listwarps``
.kyrenic: 
(Would I start the thread on the overpower mechanic or do you do it?)
tobero: 
I had something similar in thoguhts, just with warp blocks. Something like this. You just craft them, place the blck and then you can warp at those stations. (A random image from google, just as reference)

.kyrenic: 
Hmmm maybe you could have players add a custom schematic for warp blocks?
.kyrenic: 
Sort of like the plugin Brewery has for their barrel system
.kyrenic: 
I can show it on my private server if you'd like?
tobero: 
Ok, send me the ip
tobero: 
Can you see the thread?
.kyrenic: 
Yep
tobero: 
Okey
.kyrenic: 
PM me your username btw, it's whitelisted
.kyrenic: 
The commands /f setspawn and /f spawn would be good aliases for /f sethome and /f home
.kyrenic: 
Another command that would be handy is a command that lists who have been banned, I don’t think there is currently a way to do that
.kyrenic: 
Maybe /f listbans
b0b_3756: 
wars and war list 

/war {faction name} and the other faction will agree or not.

warlist

list of wars that is going to happen or going on or that has happened in the past 

idk how the war could end but it could be amount of players killer in the faction or something  but yeh it would be cool.
tobero: 
I think, that's a cool feature for the relation ships
b0b_3756: 
Jails /f jail (faction member) (time) (reason)

a faction owner must make a prison in the range of blocks when the owner puts a member of the faction in the prison they can not destroy any of the blocks that are in the area same goes with other faction members that are not in the prison, a reason why this could be good if you do laws and if someone breaks it in the game they go to jail for certain time.
tobero: 
Alright. I can put it on my extension list
b0b_3756: 
arena chunks or areas that can also be apart of a faction in an arena area faction members can fight there and keep inventory will be enabled  for the arena area  or enemies and members.
b0b_3756: 
laws 

/laws create 

basically rules

members can do /laws list to see laws of the faction.
.kyrenic: 
Oh one other question, can you add an option to choose from one of these options when entering or leaving faction territory?

.kyrenic: 
I'd personally really like the actionbar
.kyrenic: 
(Just an image I grabbed off the web, I don't play stupid minigames :P)
tobero: 
Of course I can add this
b0b_3756: 
Whatcha think bout the arena and law list thing?
tobero: 
Rules are already coming with the next version and the arenas, is keepinventory only for faction members?
b0b_3756: 
anyone who fights in the arena but really its your choice, what ever slides best with you.
tobero: 
I think I will add a option, do disable arena keepInventory for all faction enemies
b0b_3756: 
aight sounds good
tobero: 
I tried to figure the item tooltip out, but I wasn't able to do this without replacing  the players selected item for one tick with the item, that's having the  text on it. If I find a way  I will add it, but currently, it only works with `TITLE`, `SUBTITLE` and `ACTIONBAR`
.kyrenic: 
Oh that's fine
b0b_3756: 
Umm i made faction chunks but when i walk out and into it can you do like wilderness when i walk out and my faction name when i walk back in
b0b_3756: 
Along with that when you do claim chunk or claim chunk auto can we get a respone saying chunk claimed to make sure#
b0b_3756: 
And for auto claim after we done we put it again and we get a reply saying its stopped
tobero: 
I know, that's bug, but I wasn't able to fix in yesterday. Normally all this is implemented.
b0b_3756: 
Oh okay
b0b_3756: 
When you fix it will i be able to fix it right away by restart or have to download it again the latest version
tobero: 
I'm sorry. Gonna be fixed tomorrow.
b0b_3756: 
That will be fine.
tobero: 
You need to download it.l Everytime a new update gets released
tobero: 
Sorry
b0b_3756: 
Alrighty
b0b_3756: 
@[Dev] Tobero  is the update done?
tobero: 
Yes, but I'm currently fixing performance issues. I'm going to notify you, when it's done
b0b_3756: 
Oh ok im supposing the other bug where it doesnt tell you that you have claimed a chunk isnt done either cause it still aint workin for me and also yeh

how does the flags thing work and the dynmap how do i link i dont know where to get the extensions.
b0b_3756: 
On your own website it dont work
b0b_3756: 
Well your plugin on spigot it aint work.
tobero: 
Bugs are fixed. But I haven't uploaded to spigot. The dynmap extension is getting usable and downloadable for you when the next update is coming. In the next update, I fixed the bugs with the ext display. I will tell you when I upload it **Today**
b0b_3756: 
Alrighty then g
b0b_3756: 
Make an unclaim all chunk
b0b_3756: 
Nvm
b0b_3756: 
Dont
b0b_3756: 
Cause i remembered your finna fix it so they all go after deleting
tobero: 
When a faction is deleted, the server needs to save ( Auto save) and then the chunks are fully removed from the database. After that happened all the other extension get notified and so they update. But I can add this. Shouldn't be much work
b0b_3756: 
Ig so
b0b_3756: 
It could be helpful in a way
tobero: 
If you want to save manually, use /f save and it should save the faction data
adunari: 
For the needs of my server I will translate your plugin into Polish. When I'm finished, I can send you the file to put it on SpigotMC if you want, of course. regards
pipearaneda: 
hii i know that the status for PlaceholderAPI support is 3, but I consider that placeholder of the faction name is very important, it is the one that is usually used in the chat and scoreboard, please would you consider adding that one in the near future?
tobero: 
Yes, I will add this as soon as I'm home
pipearaneda: 
thankss
tobero: 
Alright. Added papi support
tobero: 
Use %faction_name% to get the displayname of the faction the player is in
pipearaneda: 
wooow thanks!
jokbon: 
Safezone and warzone with togleable pvp (so u can make pvp arenas with things like world guard)
tobero: 
Yes. This feature is going to be released when I fixed all bugs with v1.0 in 1.18
Deleted User: 
add more admin commands such as a command which give ownership or a command that make you officier
tobero: 
This is currently implement in some "hidden" way. The command /f Admin sJoin will join and give you all rights. Means that you can give someone other ranks in a bad implemened way.
tobero: 
I will put it on my to-do list
Deleted User: 
ok thanks yeah figured it gave me admin perms there
Deleted User: 
Not sure if this is suggested yet but:

Make an `/f admin safewand` command or something in that direction. So that Admins can make a region for a safe zone. Such like, after they made a selection that they can do `/f admin safezonecreate` or again, something in that direction. 

Or maybe that you can do `/f admin safezone <radius>` that you can set a radius for safezone. Maybe something like spawn protection but with safezone.

I hope I was being clear about my suggestion lol
tobero: 
I think you mean the `/f massSafezone command` avaiable in the MassClaim Extension. Use /f massSafezone pos1 / pos2 to set the positions. And use /f massSafezone claim / unclaim
tobero: 
If you meant this
Deleted User: 
I tried that but that is not working for me, wait ill go to #╰＞❔ㅐcommunity
jokbon: 
toggle /f map suggestion
tobero: 
Yes. I got this suggestion one time before. I will add it
tobero: 
If you want to change the name of thesafezone, set it in the config file and disband SafeZone. And claim a chunk to reload the zone
tobero: 
Or use sJoin to join safezone
jokbon: 
ok
tobero: 
And use settings to rename it
jokbon: 
thanks fixed all my problems
dont worry this system works for me xd
ah sugestion will be ability to add multiple system factions
tobero: 
Its just a normal faction. In the optimised version this will change. If you want to change it then, you need to go to the .lang file and change it there.In that version it's just a name, currently it's a entire faction
jokbon: 
ah sugestion will be ability to add multiple system factions
jokbon: 
and flag for crystals
tobero: 
What do you mean with "Multiple system factions"?
jokbon: 
Config option to define "system factions" like safezone (ones which cant be owerclaimed)
jokbon: 
```
CONFIG EXAMPLE:
System factions:
 - Spawn
 - Warzone
 - Crystalpvp
 - BoringTown```
tobero: 
Oh. I'll add it after making the current bug fixes
.kyrenic: 
Another cool thing would be if the server owner could set the starting permissions every faction has at faction creation, or is this already in?
tobero: 
Already implemented. In f
Config.yml
tobero: 
There are factions.flags
tobero: 
True and false statements
tobero: 
Wait not that are only settings. I will add it too
jokbon: 
**STATS**
```Faction Bank balance count
Faction members count
Faction members online count
Most killed by faction
Kills? <--use other plugin? 
Owerclaim count
Claims count ```
jokbon: 
```/f admin forcejoin <playername> <faction> ```
tobero: 
Only `%faction_toppower_1%` didn't get implemented yet
tobero: 
Got implemented in this update
jokbon: 
**DYNMAP**
```
Add option to disable vieving factions [private]
Add option to disable vieving factions [public]
Add option to disable vieving factions [system] (cant be owerclaimed)```
texos: 
/admin rank (faction) (user) (rank)

It were nice if I could change ranks in a faction without being in a faction.
~ 🌸
katiedeforest: 
I have a few features I have been wondering if it's possible to add.

- Add so you're able to click on a square on the chunk generated map and teleport to the coordinates so you don't have to walk to the other corner. 
- Add mob spawn and monster spawn true and false under /f settings. 
- Add so admins can force settings in a faction. For example /f admin settings (faction).
- Add so admins can change another players rank in a faction. For example /f admin rank (user) (rank)... if you're standing in the faction, but if not, then also type the faction name.
- Add so a command will be executed when leaving or entering the faction, worldguard has this.
- Add so you're able to change the items featured in the settings GUI. 
- Add a setting picking what rank is able to interact with each individual thing, such as chests, doors, beds, etc. For example making it so you can click on a chest under /f settings. 
- Add an option to change the name of the ranks, because I would personally like for them to be something that is related to my servers theme.
tobero: 
Have you tried SettingsAndFlag extension? Most of the setting / rank features are already built in to this extension
katiedeforest: 
No, I wasn't aware of it. I'll check it out tomorrow. Thanks!
tobero: 
Alright. Give it a try
geko_off.: 
Add the /f home command to add a faction home
tobero: 
There is already a /f home. Install home extension using /f extension download HomeExtension
geko_off.: 
aw ok
geko_off.: 
And the /f chest for faction chest ?
tobero: 
No. That's not a thing. Dou you need it? I think I will be able to add it real quick
geko_off.: 
A yes it would be a very good addition please!
tobero: 
Alright
jokbon: 
thats same as faction vault
tobero: 
Yes. I already thought that it's something like that
geko_off.: 
In fact I use another faction plugins, but it was buggy so I came to yours but it doesn't have everything it had :/ Ducoup I offer you in things it had :]
tobero: 
This plugin is buggy too. See #╰―＞🔌ㅐto-doˈs
geko_off.: 
yes but much less and I already have lots of ideas for yours x) [ You will work thanks to me ]
geko_off.: 
Want designs for your menu? :]
tobero: 
Which menu?
geko_off.: 
for /f setting ?
tobero: 
Yeah. If you like
geko_off.: 
The gray banner to rename the faction
The blue banner to set the description of the faction
The white banner to set the motd of the faction
The blue dye for the ranks

The green banner to invite a member
The orange dye to kick a member
The red dye to banish a member
The gate to open to the public or not

geko_off.: 
:]
tobero: 
Will make it today. Should be usable in 6 - 7 hours if you still need it
tobero: 
That's a great concept. Will add it to the new version (Not beta)
tobero: 
You can now download FactionChest Extension using /f extension download FactionChest
geko_off.: 
Add in the parameters, the display of the faction name when we speak in the chat, example: [Faction name] Geko: text, with a command like /f color with a color panel that is displayed to change the color of the faction name in chat [ Paid or no ]
tobero: 
Isn't it already a thing? When you create a faction with a color code (`/f create &a&lName` as example) all displays should display the name with color.

When you want it only avaiable for specific ranks on your server, there is a `faction.color.allowColorInName` permission, defaulted to true
tobero: 
If that's your suggestion
geko_off.: 
But faction names don't show up in front of nicknames for me :/
jokbon: 
Thats prefix
tobero: 
Have you installed chat message extension?
geko_off.: 
Eu what is the command?
tobero: 
Or do you like to use essentails chat? For that you need Papi. Then you can use %faction_display%
tobero: 
`/f extension download ChatMessageExtension`
geko_off.: 
Aww ok
geko_off.: 
thx
mashirothegreat: 
@Support i need help with a bug, i cant claim chunks whilest being deoped
jokbon: 
you need permisions added to players
use permision plugin like luckperms
jokbon: 
i think owner will add default permisions of the plugin later
tobero: 
Are you able to access /f claim?
tobero: 
The most common problem is permission handling. And its easy to fix: Just install LuckPerm and give the default users the permission faction.commands.claim
mashirothegreat: 
ye thanks
mashirothegreat: 
what one would it be??

mashirothegreat: 
do i have to enable all factions commands???
mashirothegreat: 
@[Dev] Tobero
tobero: 
Only the ones that you want your users   be able to use. Most of them have should be allowed
tobero: 
By default, but that's bugged
axolotl_bucket.: 
@[Dev] Tobero is there any timeline for dynmap to update factions properly?
tobero: 
A server restart
tobero: 
Will get fixed when I drop the extension for the v1
axolotl_bucket.: 
when dis drop hapenin'
tobero: 
Very soon after the release of the optimised version :). It looks very promising too me that this is going to happen in the next few week.

If you want to see (current / not up-to-date) optimised version, you can download it in #╰＞🌸ㅐoff-topic
hash_guy: 
Hello. I came here to learn about this wonderful plugin.
I have a suggestion. How about displaying particles on the border between factions that you belong to and those that you don't so that you can tell them apart?
tobero: 
This is a planned feature for V1. Thanks for the suggestion 
https://discord.com/channels/819932760550014986/885096079635402753/885099216635035688
hash_guy: 
ok.
hash_guy: 
I am looking forward to it.
jokbon: 
Tobero make permisions have op or admin prefix so it wont be as confusing
for example:
`faction.commands.op.Unclaim` / `faction.commands.admin.Unclaim`
tobero: 
Alright. If you think it will be usefull, I can add it to the new versions
katiedeforest: 
Hey, you should add a chest permission under /F settings
katiedeforest: 
Because right now it's connected to redstone
katiedeforest: 
I don't want my members to use our redstone door, but they can use their own chests. This only works if I allow redstone
tobero: 
Have you tried using SettingsAndFlag extension? This adds chest access permissions and others to. If you don't like any of them, just set them to false in the config.yml

jokbon: 
**Suggestion for improvements and penalities**
some thonks how improvements and penalities shud work.
katiedeforest: 
Me and a friend have tested it, and it seems like they are only able to interact with things if they have build permission. Even the open doors one don't count for iron doors, neither does redstone apparently. It all depends on build permissions.
Which in my opinion, only should account for placing blocks and not interacting with iron doors and chests.
tobero: 
Yes. That should it be really
tobero: 
But... it interactions aren't bound to place / breaking
tobero: 
While creating, I needed to disable interactions with custom event
.hydroxy: 
That every faction can set there color
tobero: 
Is planned / already done
mow_cat: 
this might be complicated, but i would love to set precise 3d regions the same way you can with worldguard/worldedit instead of only ever selecting full chunks. maybe a separate option for enabling/disabling it
tobero: 
Hmm. That would be very hard to implement, because the entire system is based on chunks and traditional factions, as I know it, got always played with chunk claims.

If you'd like to use something like that, maybe try towny (I think its something like that, haven't tried it myself)
mow_cat: 
when i log in, im already in wilderness
but it still says wilderness when i move out of the chunk i was in

could there be an option to disable this?
tobero: 
There was one in Beta, but there isn't one in v1
mow_cat: 
where was it?
i dont see it in config
tobero: 
Oh. Sorry. I had thought you wanted to disable the text entirely. This thing can't be disabled in Beta, because it's a problem with how I handle movements. Alpha and later version have fixed this issue, because I changed to a more better text check
mow_cat: 
oh
jokbon: 
placeholder api for faction you standing in (maybe bad idea)
tobero: 
Will be able to implement it
jokbon: 
it will need cache or something
tobero: 
I would have just made a check, that tries to get the current chunk of a player, if they aren't same, get the registry from it.
bcat2616: 
vertical particles when using /sc,
red is enemy
green is ur claim
white is ally
gray or oragne is neutral
bcat2616: 
my suggestion :)
tobero: 
Think you mean that, right?

On the same level as the user?
bcat2616: 
ye
bcat2616: 
ig just inbetween
tobero: 
Where in-between?
bcat2616: 
so there now lines on chunk corners
bcat2616: 
so horizontal between those a couple at eye level
tobero: 
Okey, I see
bcat2616: 
might make too much lag idk
tobero: 
Yep, that's why it will be an extension, so that you can remove it when it's too laggy
jokbon: 
particle count config option lol
jokbon: 
and duration
josh65: 
Add an update checker for people who aren't in the discord. Should show a message to people with a permission showing "Your version is outdated - new version X.X.X - <spigot link here>" in chat
tobero: 
There is one, but I'm always forgetting to update the version with each update
josh65: 
oh right is it not possible to detect changes to the spigot update section since it always adds a new one there
tobero: 
probably yes

tobero: 
You would like factions to declare a area where it's their main base?
are7ee: 
like a faction can have towns and a capital t AL
tobero: 
nice idea, can add it when I'm bored and don't have to do anything
leonzockt01: 
Suggestion: You could add a range to auto-claim and unclaim, example: "/f claim auto 3" to claim everything in 3 chunks range from the player
josh65: 
the mass claim extention might do that already
leonzockt01: 
Already forgot about massclaim haha
leonzockt01: 
My bad
leonzockt01: 
Never got to test it
tobero: 
Just install it
tobero: 
I have coded it yesterday with three other extensions
tobero: 
/f extension download
tobero: 
Just that everyone knows, suggestions can be everything. 
Some examples:
- Change message for command help command to something like this (image of the message)
- Make command accessible through gui
- Change command output of /f mass claim to only show how many chunks got claimed and how many failed
- Put /f mass  to /f claim mass
- Make guis configurable through config
- Add faction permission

Just everything you don't like in the current version and with an example on how to do it better. I want to make the plugin fit it's community, which is using it.

jokbon: 
this must be more readable as i added colors
leonzockt01: 
1. Would be really cool to see different colors of the factions with the dynmap extension (if possible)
2. There could be a sound when entering another faction, maybe even different ones for different relations
leonzockt01: 
Any opinions on that?
tobero: 
Aren't colours for dynmap already added?
tobero: 
But sounds will be customizable using the action system coming with 1.5
leonzockt01: 
It's set to yellow in my faction, but on the dynmap it's still shown in red
tobero: 
Still white with red border?
leonzockt01: 
Yes
leonzockt01: 
@[Dev] Tobero Colors on dynmap actually do work, my bad
leonzockt01: 
But it would be nice if the border color could also be changed
tobero: 
Yep, will look how I could change that
josh65: 
Could there be a config option to follow papers no permision error message.
tobero: 
How do you mean it? That there is no message saying you have no permissions (
tobero: 
?
josh65: 
yeah when the user dosnt have permistions it currently has it own mesge and says what permision is needed. i would like it to follow the one in papers config file instead
tobero: 
So, basically just customize the permission message?
josh65: 
yeah
tobero: 
Isn't it already in the lang files?
josh65: 
for the config folder not that i can see. I search permission only comes up with in faction ones
tobero: 
Did you search the lang/en_us.json one?
josh65: 
yeah its the only one i have
tobero: 
Okey. Will add it, sure thing
tobero: 
Will get uploaded with the other fixes and features in v1.6
josh65: 
thanks
tobero: 
No problem
josh65: 
could there be an option to set the default settings of territory display position
josh65: 
Also support for the dynmap extention to live update when a setting changes. Currently I have to restart the server for it to show.
leonzockt01: 
This actually had worked for me last time I checked
josh65: 
and for the on click content to have classes so that they can be customised better
