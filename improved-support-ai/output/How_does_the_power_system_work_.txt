worstedsphere: 
Great! Does going to war with another faction and winning add power? Vise versa with losing wars?
jokbon: 
@Worstedsphereplaytime
jokbon:

tobero: 
it hasn't been implemented in the v2.0.0 versions. If you need it now, you'd havet o use v1.x.x

If you're interested in how it will work in the future, here's the ticket for it: https://github.com/users/ToberoCat/projects/3?pane=issue&itemId=35382367 (Suggestions are welcome)
