  registry-regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9-_]' # !DANGER! This is a regex. This regex is used to determine which characters should get replaced with spaces. The default value will replace everything that isn't a letter, number, underscore or dash. When you change this to a regex that allows illegal characters, your file system doesn't support, it will cause the plugin to crash. Leave it defaulted unless you know what you're doing

    permanent: false # !WARNING! Marks a faction to exist even when no players are in it anymore. This allows faction owners to leave. Should only be changed when you know what you're doing.
    start-balance: 0 # The amount of money a faction has when starting out. Note: This might cause money glitches, when creating a factions is free (or at least below the start balance) (Creating factions, transfer the money to owner account, delete, repeat). Might get fixed in future versions

################# Advanced config options #####################
#
# A database always syncs up ith the server, meaning that you can run this plugin on multiple
# server while still keeping your data synchronized
#
# Useful with Multipaper, Velocity, BungeeCord, etc
#
# This will save RAM on the minecraft server side.
# Only one database should be selected with true
# When no database is selected, it will run locally using the plugin data folder
#
storage:
  use-mysql: false
  mysql: # Only when use-mysql is set to true
    host: "localhost" # Host is the ip address of the mysql server
    port: "3306" # Port is the port the service is listing at
    user: "root" # The user this plugin is allowed to use. Note: Don't use root, create a new user with permissions to just manage improved factions tables
    password: "1234" # The password of the user given above

################# Performance #####################
# These settings can seriously screw your server when not being set perfectly.
# Bad settings might cause too much of ram being used or your cpu cycles being wasted.
# Be careful when editing it. Keep a backup and benchmark before putting it into production.

performance:
  ram:
    claim-garbage-collector: 6000 # Define how fast claims get unloaded again. Default: 6000 ticks (5 minutes). 20 ticks = 1 second. Smaller value will reduce RAM usage, but increases stress on the cpu for cleaning. A too small value will overload your disk, because everything needed to be loaded and instantly being rejected from ram again
